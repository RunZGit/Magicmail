1/29/12 2:05,Five Dollars,"To the person who took $5 out of my girlfriend's wallet before they either returned it to her friend or placed it back on the ground, she noticed. She's too nice to make it a thing. I'm not. I don't know what appeal to make to a petty thief, so I hope these words get your attention. That five dollars was not meant for you, nor are you entitled to it. Here is my problem: You saw a flower-covered wallet filled with trinkets, credit cards, notes to herself, and cash on the ground; left the notes because they're of no use to you, left the credit cards because you're too scared to be a real thief, left the heart-shaped dollar because it seems like something that has sentimental value worth more than one dollar (and it does, so thank you I guess), and took the cash because you're too weak to remove the inherent greed a dollar brings about from the person that you took it from. That's my problem. You. That is not how we do things here, and if it's how you do things, you don't deserve to be here.   I hope that makes at least five dollars worth of sense.

We are the only owners; purchased new in February, 2005. It has been regularly maintained, and runs well. I would guess that 3/4 of the miles have been highway miles. No one has smoked in it. Interior has some normal wear but in excellent shape. Exterior is very good; a few small rubs/scratches.

Since we are not in D.C., why not show our support here in Terre Haute! Please bring your nurslings! Even if you bottle feed, please join us!

8/2/12 10:30,Car For Sale: 2003 Mazda Protege5,"Asking $6,000
 92,100 miles
 manual 5-speed transmission
 laser blue
 4-door wagon/hatchback body style
 -- see attachment for a picture --


 Options/Extras/Special Features:
     power glass sunroof
     factory roof rack
     in-dash 6-disc CD changer
     front side airbags
     four wheel ABS
     remote keyless entry
     cruise control


  Also Included:
     factory service manual
     two Rocky Mounts bike carriers (attaches to factory roof rack)


 Why it's special:
     maintenance records available
     new clutch
     new timing belt
     new water pump


 This sporty FWD hatch has served me well over the years, but it's time to move on. You can fit a surprisingly large amount of stuff in this car (especially if you use the roof rack). It's rated 22/28/24 mpg on regular fuel; fits four people comfortably (five for short trips); and has only lived in a snowy area for 3 years (it originally resided in California). The timing belt and water pump replacement (suggested at 105k miles) have already been taken care of, saving you a major service cost. The original clutch was wearing out, so I had that replaced very recently as well.  Subsequently it should serve you well for many years to come.


 Contact me if you're interested.


 Thanks,

Registration 11:00 am,
Walk starts at 12:00 pm
Alzheimer’s Disease is currently the 6th leading cause of death in the US, but it is projected to rise.  It normally afflicts the elderly causing confusion, loss of long-term memory problems, dementia, and eventually death.  But its affect is on entire families as those with the disease are incapable of taking care of themselves.  Eventually, someone with Alzheimer’s will need 24/7 care in a nursing home.
We ask you to join us to at the Walk to End Alzheimer’s Disease in order raise awareness of the disease by walking (1 mile).  If you can, please donate to the Alzheimer’s Association; however, we really want people walking in order to raise awareness of the disease.  You can register to walk online at

It will be a short meeting to discuss any questions people may have. We are also going to be helping people sign up online if they are interested. Below are some of the most common questions asked from students.  What is Best Buddies?  - Well, Best Buddies College (BBC) pairs adult individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in one-to-one friendships with college students.  What are the requirements for the Best Buddies College Program?  - Anyone is welcome to be a part of Best Buddies. We require that you submit a completed application, complete a matching survey (if your planning on being a College Buddy), commit to the program and have an interest in forming a new friendship.  What if I don't have time for a new friendship, but still want to be involved?  - Then you want to be an Associate Member! An Associate Member is a college student that is a member of Best Buddies, attends Chapter events, helps out the Chapter when needed, but does not have a personal Buddy. The student is welcome to join other Buddy Pairs on outings, but normally just does not have enough time to commit to Best Buddies.

They ignored the directive and persisted in forcing students to file between them as they exited. At best, their aggressive tactics were an invasion of students' personal space.

9/13/12 22:57,Why we're here,"If anybody is interested in learning more about Christianity and why people like the Gideons do what they do, feel free to ask me, or a number of the other Christian students at this school. The majority of students here at Rose are religious and see value in a purpose driven life. I encourage all to seek answers to their questions and make well informed decisions rather than attempting to do what society expects.   If you care, here is a little bit about me, and what God is doing in my life.  I grew up in a small town in Idaho with a population of around 400. We don’t have any malls, movie theaters, or even fast food. We had dial up internet until my junior year and even then the internet was practically useless. My county is one of the poorest in the nation with an unemployment rate of 14 percent and an average income of about $30,000/yr. Kids from there aren’t expected to do anything with their life. In fact most take minimum wage job or very physical jobs working 60-80hrs per week. I was different though.   I was brought up in a small Wesleyan church and was shown the love of Christ from the time I was born. At the age of 10 I accepted that Jesus Christ was my Lord and Savior and I devoted my life to serve Him. From that day, I have never been alone or been betrayed by Him. The amazing thing about God is that he loves each of us for who we are, no questions asked. I mean, He sent his only son to Earth to die for our sins, so that we wouldn’t have to face death for our sins. Because of that sacrifice I can live my life excited for what is to come. I know that one day I will be able to sit beside God and enjoy all the miracles of the universe for eternity.   That is awesome. It only takes a simple commitment that I believe Jesus Christ is Lord and that God raised Him from the dead to free me from my sins. God did this because he loves each of us like a father loves their child. For this salvation, He asks me to love others and to spread his word so that others may experience the same benefits that I do. I would gladly make that commitment, and I have. I enjoy the benefit of having a friend and a father to help me with any of my daily troubles. God has shown me how big He really is. I mean, I’m a nobody. I’m a hick kid from Idaho, who doesn’t deserve to even be given the chance to attend a school like this let alone make it to the end and graduate. I’m not perfect, I far from it. I have as many faults as anyone, and if it weren’t for God’s helping hand guiding my thoughts and actions, I never would have even heard of this school.   God is great, and He wants you to be able to experience the same connection and sense of worth that I do. It really is as simple as saying “God, I know you are real and I want to dedicate my life to you.” That’s it. If you said that to yourself and meant it, you secured yourself a place in heaven. No hoops to jump though, no mumbo jumbo. Your walk with God should be a relationship, not a religion. God will answer your prayers and take you places you never dreamed possible. I hope you take time to look into religion and understand the importance of it.  “If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.” Romans 10:9  A simple prayer to accept Jesus Christ as your savior: Lord Jesus, Please forgive my sins. Thank you for dying on the cross for me and freeing me of my sins. Help me to live my life as you’ve commanded, loving others as you have loved us. Please send me the Holy Spirit and help me to live by it. Amen.  Here is my email: summeraw@rose-hulman.edu  If you want to talk to me about my faith or about any questions you have, please do. I will be more than happy to help out in any way I can. ",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal
9/13/12 23:57,Sharepoint etiquette and purpose,"
To those individuals who are abusing Sharepoint:
Sharepoint is an announcement system used for making campus announcements, such as: an event that is being held, lost and found, selling something, ect. It is NOT a forum to tell your life story or to express your beliefs in God, the flying spaghetti monster, or the loch ness monster. You want to announce that you're having a storytime meeting? Great! Tell us the time and the place and we will decide whether to come or not. You want to hold a debate about religion? Again, great - tell us when and where it's happening. Stop abusing the purpose of the system to preach to people and to tell stories. It's rude. It's obnoxious. It devalues sharepoint as a tool to make legitimate announcements when you flood it with crap, just like no one listens anymore to the boy who cried wolf. So please, I implore you, act professionally; you're messaging every member of the institute - please show some respect in doing so. Thank you for your time. ",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

Members of our community may have belief in deity, whatever form it may be.  There are others who may not.  Prof. Anthony called a valid point of procedure and it was followed up by Mr. Summerfield.  Sharepoint is a service to our campus community.  A service that which, depending on the message, may be viewed as abuse or wonderful depending on the audience.  Based on your post below, you have no right to criticize anyone.  Dr. Zac Chambers  Hey all! If I can get 800 people to just click the following link I can get the much needed new tires for my truck.

A description of his book is below.  Please contact me if you would like a PDF of the book to look at or if you would like to collaborate in helping a young professional put together his ideas about the subjects!  The book is called the Greatest Source of Energy and details are below! Thanks (haftrm@rose-hulman.edu)   ""The Greatest Source of Energy describes a new method for combining the two most powerful theories in science—General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics—into what is known as the Theory of Everything.  The foundation of the method is a new model of time—called Temporal Energy Theory—that unites the view of time as a relative phenomenon with the view of time as an absolute and universal phenomenon.  If Temporal Energy Theory is proven to be correct, it will have redeemed Newton’s idea of a universal background clock, without taking anything away from Einstein’s idea that time is relative.  The benefits of successfully combining General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are endless, but a way to bridge the gap between these two theories has been elusive for many years. The Greatest Source of Energy breaks new ground in the intense work on unification and may put us on a path to a better understanding of the universe.""  http://greatestsourceofenergy.com/",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

10/19/12 14:14,Mono is spreading; try to avoid catching it,"Hello fellow students,

  A lot of people have been getting Mono. Health services hasn't made any kind of public announcement that I know of, so I figured I would. Mono is passed through saliva, including indirectly (via shared cup, etc). Mono makes you need a lot of sleep and destroys your energy, and this can last for weeks (or months if you're particularly unlucky). As Rose students, you probably don't get enough sleep as it is, so please, try not to get mono. That just means not sharing cups/water bottles with everyone, and not going around kissing everyone.

  Also, it takes several weeks between becoming contagious and showing symptoms. You probably know people that have mono and don't have symptoms yet. Be careful about it.

Our Green Valley Conference 2012 is a conference and exhibition for citizens and business owners interested in becoming more sustainable. 
Our Green Valley Conference 2012 is the premier conference in the Wabash Valley focused on bringing the latest information and techniques to citizens and business owners.  Urban and community design advocate Dan Burden will be the keynote speaker for the event.  Dan was named by TIME magazine as “one of the six most important civic innovators in the world.”  
Burden will kick off the two-day conference and provide his professional assessment of the walkability of certain portions of Terre Haute. Breakout sessions following Burden’s talk on November 9 will feature national, regional and local speakers on topics covering six focus areas:
·      Local foods
·      Waste stream management
·      Energy consumption
·      Social justice
·      Walkable, bikable, liveable communities
·      Environmental stewardship
 
On Saturday, November 10, OGVA will hold its first annual meeting and will present the findings of a community survey currently being fielded to assess perceptions about quality of life and sustainable practices in Vigo County. (To take the survey, go to: http://www.isusustainability.org/survey)Following the presentation, attendees will be invited to participate in round table discussions to help lay the foundation for a Sustainability Plan for our community. The Saturday events are free and open to the public.
“Anytime there is a discussion around sustainability, it creates momentum toward change. Folks in the Wabash Valley can learn a lot from attending a sustainability conference, from making changes in their home to their work place,” said OGVA education committee chair, Jane Santucci.
Conference registration for Friday’s events is $35 for adults and $10 for students until November 2. After November 2, registration is $45 for adults and students. For more information and to register, go to: www.ourgreenvalley.org/registration.

11/20/12 21:49,ROSE HULMAN DANCE TEAM,"
Hello everyone!
 
You may have heard that the Dance Team is starting up again!
 
I have attached the audition flier! Below is some more information just in case you are curious!
 
There will be two factions of the Dance Team: the ‘Company Line’ and the ‘Education Line’.
 
The Company Line will be those who are comfortable performing and will focus on learning the Dance Team repertoire.
 
The Education Line will focus on dance technique and training for students who may not be able to make the time commitment to the Company Line, or simply wish to take classes without other obligations.
 
Both lines will take class together! So for any given practice, the first 45 minutes will be a technique class (ballet / jazz / lyrical / modern / hip hop), the Company Line will then have a 15 minute break while the Education Line will  finish out the hour of the class. At the end of the hour the Education Line will be dismissed and the Company Line will begin an hour long choreography workshop.
 
Here’s an outline of what to expect:
 
Practices: 
·       Company Line: 3 regular practices  (45 min: warm up / technique –  1 hour workshop: Captain teaches choreography , VP and P take notes / fix problems / administer advice)
o  Note: There will be 4 practices offered. One will serve as an alternate in case there is a conflict with exams or other practices
·       Education Line: 2 practices (1 hour - dance technique ballet/jazz, or ballet/modern, or jazz/lyrical)
 
Fundraising for Need-Based-Dues [other than mandatory $30.00 entry fee]:
·       Car wash
·       Bake Sale
·       Raffle
 
Projected Performances (anticipated not confirmed)
·       Company Line performs at games / peprally / homecoming / dance shows
·       Education Line performs at dance shows
·       Separate dances will be choreographed for each level when competing with the possibility of a big group piece
 
Projected Dance Team Projects (giving back to the arts) :
·       Annual dance performance (open to anyone in the school / other dance studios)
·       Treated like a dance talent show (showcase)
·       Dance Team will have group pieces
·       Dance Team members can audition for solos / small group pieces
·       All proceeds go to local arts groups (specifics TBD)
 
If you have any questions please let me know by emailing me atwatsonge@rose-hulman.edu or tweet us @DanceRHIT !
 
 
Thanks,

Hope you're having a good break! My name is James Benedicto and I'm a sophomore here at RHIT. Sorry for the wall of text. I've tried to reduce it without leaving out information. Go ahead and skip the stuff you have no interest in :P. 
A:LoL Tourney and Club 
B:Minecraft Server 
C:Teamspeak 3 Server 
--- 
A: League of Legends Tournament and Club Creation 
--- 
I'm gathering people who may have an interest in participating in an intra-collegiate League of Legends bi-weekly tournament (as in every two weeks) and eventually creating a LoL club on campus. 
If the club was created, the funding will most likely go to prizes in the form of rp and/or food for the tourneys. In regards to the tentative one during second week, it will be just for fun. 
If you are interested in participating, the tentative rules can be found here: 
https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2ISPUX97nRNdC14Yy1QajZqQ00 
and please email me at benedijp@rose-hulman.edu saying if you are speaking on behalf of a whole team (5 people), a partial team, or an individual. This tourney may not happen if not enough people are interested, so please respond before second week. 
You can also email me if you have suggestions for changes to the (tentative) rules. 
--- 
B: Minecraft Server on Percopo 3 
--- 
I'll be starting up both a vanilla and modded minecraft server that will be up during 1st week once the upgrade parts come in. 
When they are up, you can find them at the following addresses (which you can put directly into your minecraft server list in game): 
Vanilla: puremc.rhitgaming.com 
Modded: modmc.rhitgaming.com:25566 
This will be a dedicated server meaning it will be available 24/7 (minus server maintenance, backups, and updates which will be announced beforehand) on a 2.3 GHz i7 Ivy Bridge processor with 16GB memory. This machine will ONLY be used for minecraft servers along with a teamspeak 3 server, wiki, and web-hosting services for LoL tourney and other info. A total of 14GB of physical memory will be dedicated to the two minecraft servers, each receiving an amount depending on their popularity. 
The modded server will be based on the ftb mod pack with only these mods enabled as of MCv1.4.5 (found here:http://feed-the-beast.com/):
 Advanced Machines, Advanced Solar Panels, Buildcraft 3, EnderStorage, Extrabiomes XL, Forestry, GraviSuite, IC2 Nuclear Control, Industrial Craft 2, Iron Chests, Modular Force Field System 2, obsidiplates, railcraft, steve's carts 2, and thermal expansion. 
Information on installation and clarifying of rules (basically no griefing) will follow later on the (basic) minecraft.rhitgaming.com website. PLEASE BACKUP WORLDS BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO INSTALL MODS. I am not responsible for loss or corrupted worlds when attempting to install mods. Selective mods are disabled to reduce server lag, but you can email me at benedijp@rose-hulman.edu and try to convince me to reenable them. Mods not in the FTB mod pack will not be considered due to the complex nature of mod compatibility. 
--- 
C:Teamspeak 3 server and the general rhitgaming.com 
--- 
A teamspeak 3 server will also be available sometime 1st week which will be found at: teamspeak.rhitgaming.com 
A very basic website consisting of LoL tournament info and statistics, minecraft info and mod installation instructions, and emails sent out from the Anime, Board Game, and Magic: The Gathering club all in one place will also be available. 
 
Any other questions can, as mentioned, be emailed to me at benedijp@rose-hulman.edu. Thanks for your time and see some of you back at Rose :D.",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

This tournament would be run using a simulator known as Pokemon Online, which allows you to choose your Pokemon, their abilities, their natures, their moves, and their levels, and distribute stats accordingly. Basically, you have full control to pick the team of your choice.   Pokemon are normally distributed into tiers based on their power, and we would play 3 of them at most, likely some combination of Ubers, OU, UU, and RU. If you are unfamiliar with the tiers, we will be going by the lists defined on the Pokemon Online website. Feel free to check them out.  I'm just gauging interest at this point, so if you would be interested in participating or have any questions, shoot me an e-mail at vaughtlo@rose-hulman.edu. Let me know which tiers you would prefer, while you're at it. If I get enough interest, I'll send out another SharePoint letting everyone know.",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

But with all that happiness, most of us brought back a few things we could all live without during the holidays:  the stress, the fatigue, and those 3-5 extra pounds that seem to come oh-so-easily.  Being here on campus, it is easy to get caught up in homework, deadlines, family, significant others and activities and our health takes a toll as a result.   I say its time to take care of yourself and your body.

GALLANTFEW GLOBAL RUNNING EVENT DRAWS ATTENTION TO CHALLENGES FACING MILITARY VETERANS RETURNING FROM ACTIVE DUTY
28-day, 565-mile trek by US Army Ranger and combat veteran CPL Cory Smith in 2012 inspires launch of global fundraising running event Run Ranger Run, which kicks off February 2, 2013.
Austin, TX – GallantFew, a charitable nonprofit organization which provides support to military veterans transitioning from active duty to civilian life, announced today the launch of Run Ranger Run 2013 and its February 2, kick-off event in Burnet, Texas. More than 250 participants from around the globe have already registered to participate.
Run Ranger Run was born in 2012, when 3rd Ranger Battalion veteran US Army Corporal Smith, having deployed to combat twice, made the long 28 day and 565 mile trek from Fort Benning, GA to Indianapolis, IN in the dead of winter in order to raise awareness of the enormous economic, social, employment and psychological challenges that military veterans face in transitioning from the difficulties our honored veterans face as they transition from active military service to the life of a civilian.
Corporal Smith’s run inspired thousands of others looking for a way to support military veterans, and led to the creation of the 1st Annual Run Ranger Run Global Running Event. Run Ranger Run 2013 invites individuals to form teams of up to ten people who will jointly pledge to run, walk or bike a combined 565 miles in the month of February. Teams may be formed anywhere in the world, and all participants will raise funds for GallantFew and increase awareness for veteran issues surrounding the transition from active military service to civilian life.
“The overwhelming positive response to last year’s inspiring run by Corporal Smith demonstrated that people recognized how important the issue is, and that there was a desire to take action in order to raise awareness to the unique challenges facing our military veterans,” Karl Monger, Executive Director, GallantFew. “The launch of Run Ranger Run on a global scale marks the beginning of an annual fundraising initiative that we believe can make a real difference in the lives of our honored veterans.”
To Form or Join a Run Ranger Run running team, simply visit http://www.runrangerrun.com/ and sign up with a few clicks of the mouse.
Candyss Bryant, Run Ranger Run coordinator and GallantFew spokesperson, adds: “By enabling individuals to easily sign up, participate, and track progress throughout the month of February, our goal was to make Run Ranger Run an event that anyone can participate in, have fun, and truly change lives.”
Combat Veteran CPL Cory Smith is a graduate of Indiana State University and a native of Shelbyville, IN.

About GallantFew
GallantFew – A Revolutionary Veteran Support Network and a 501c3 Non-Profit Organization sponsored Cory during his journey by coordinating material support, event coordination, as well as medical and logistical support. Cory's journey and mission became known as Run Ranger Run.

2/7/13 20:39,"Climb tree, ride bike, play GLADIATOR BALL!","Are you tired of never having played Gladiator Ball?!  Well come on down to the SRC fieldhouse tomorrow at 7 PM and change all that!   I don't need to tell you that Gladiator Ball is one of the toughest sports around.  I don't need to tell you that Gladiator Ball is a lot like volleyball in the way that it is played on a v-ball court.  And I'm sure that you are already aware that unlike volleyball, Gladiator Ball has a 15 ft gap in the middle, designated 'No Man's Land', instead of a net. And of course, as you are already aware, it consists of hurling a 12lb, beachball size, semi-cushioned medicine ball at the opposing team, scoring as the ball plows through the enemy and strikes the floor.   Is this a sport for the weak of heart and body? Nay!  I say once more, NAY! Why should I waste my breath declaring that penalties result in 10 burpies for the player who beefed, when you already know this?!    And why do you already know these things? Because you've been waiting for the chance to partake in the sport of bravery, the sport of valor, the sport of courage THAT IS GLADIATOR BALL since you were a wee lad (or lass)!  Here's a link of myself, family, and friends playing.  https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151228488861378&set=vb.504156377&type=2&theater  Be warned: Gladiator Ball requires commitment.  If you are not sore the day following playing this, then you are made out of titanium, you're clearly a superhero, and should obviously be out fighting crime instead of sleep deprivation and anxiety disorders which Rose so graciously affords her children.  A bare minimum of 10 players is needed, but 12 works the best. If you are interested, send me, Bruce, an email at costonbj@rose-hulman.edu or text me at 219-369-3191 so I know we have enough fearless players to make this happen.

About Daffodil Days
You can give hope to people facing cancer and save lives by supporting the American Cancer Society Daffodil Days program. The Daffodil Days program is your chance to fight back against cancer by raising funds and awareness to help beat the disease. While the Daffodil Days program involves offering daffodils every spring to donors in appreciation for their contributions, it is about more than just giving beautiful flowers - it is everyone's opportunity to create a world with less cancer and more birthdays, where cancer never steals another year from anyone's life.
The dollars you raise through the Daffodil Days program do make a difference. Your support allows the American Cancer Society to save lives and create a world with more birthdays by helping people stay well and get well, by finding cures, and by fighting back against cancer.
They make excellent gifts for secret pals, friends, co-workers, etc.!
Cost:
Bunch-10 flowers=$10.00
Bunch + vase=$15.00
Gift of Hope=$25.00 minimum (Gift of Hope A Gift of Hope donation funds cancer research, educational programs, advocacy, services for cancer patients and their families, and furthers the mission of the American Cancer Society. The Gift of Hope also enables your American Cancer Society to deliver flowers anonymously to cancer patients at medical centers and facilities in your community. Gifts of Hope are not delivered to specific cancer patients, nor are the donor's name attached to the gift.)
 
Flowers will be delivered March 19-22, 2013. 
Deadline to order is FRIDAY MARCH 1, 2013.
Checks can be made out to: American Cancer Society

About Daffodil Days
You can give hope to people facing cancer and save lives by supporting the American Cancer Society Daffodil Days program. The Daffodil Days program is your chance to fight back against cancer by raising funds and awareness to help beat the disease. While the Daffodil Days program involves offering daffodils every spring to donors in appreciation for their contributions, it is about more than just giving beautiful flowers - it is everyone's opportunity to create a world with less cancer and more birthdays, where cancer never steals another year from anyone's life.
The dollars you raise through the Daffodil Days program do make a difference. Your support allows the American Cancer Society to save lives and create a world with more birthdays by helping people stay well and get well, by finding cures, and by fighting back against cancer.
They make excellent gifts for secret pals, friends, co-workers, etc.!
Cost:
Bunch-10 flowers=$10.00
Bunch + vase=$15.00
Gift of Hope=$25.00 minimum (Gift of Hope A Gift of Hope donation funds cancer research, educational programs, advocacy, services for cancer patients and their families, and furthers the mission of the American Cancer Society. The Gift of Hope also enables your American Cancer Society to deliver flowers anonymously to cancer patients at medical centers and facilities in your community. Gifts of Hope are not delivered to specific cancer patients, nor are the donor's name attached to the gift.)

Flowers will be delivered March 19-22, 2013.
Deadline to order is FRIDAY MARCH 1, 2013.

Supra-molecular Aggregation as monitored by Static and Dynamic Light Scattering
 
Zachary Wiersma
Luanne Tilstra, Ph.D.
Wednesday, March 6
5th period, 11:45 a.m.
Room G315
 
 
Insulin association controls the functionality and effectiveness of insulin in the body. However, insulin can self-aggregate in ways not fully understood, removing it from the bloodstream. The degree of aggregation can be studied under different conditions to yield information about the optimization of insulin use. A capillary electrophoresis-laser light scattering (CE-LLS) instrument has been constructed on campus for this purpose. However, proof of concept experiments revealed contradictory size data in several polystyrene test bead solutions used for calibration. To determine the true sizes and clustering of these particles, dynamic light scattering and static light scattering were employed. The dynamic light scattering system was assembled and tested and the static light scattering system was used for confirmation. Despite attempts at signal-to-noise ratio correction, the noise in the dynamic light scattering system was too great to overcome, and the system was eventually abandoned. However, the static light scattering system was able to determine the size distribution of the bead solutions. The 45 and 90 µm beads yielded static light scattering values of about 45 and 90 µm, respectively. However, the majority of the 1 µm beads yielded a size value of 500 µm. These data prove that extreme aggregation occurred for the 1 µm test beads, resulting in unexpected patterns in the CE-LLS system. These results completed the goal of the project and provided useful information for the CE-LLS project and for future studies of insulin aggregation.

Faraday Rotation and Raman Spectroscopy 
of Aqueous Solutions of Ferric Salts.
 
Max Verkamp
Dr. Maarij Syed, PHOE
Dr. Daniel Morris, C&BC
 
Wednesday, March 27
5th period, 11:45 a.m.
Room G315


Faraday Rotation, the rotation of light induced in transparent media by a magnetic field, is a phenomenon commonly used in optical systems. In this presentation, the application of this technique to chemical systems as a probe of magnetic properties of aqueous iron(III) solutions will be investigated. The theory of Faraday Rotation will be discussed, followed by a description of the current research and results. By measuring the rotation of solutions at varying magnetic field strength using a carefully designed optical system with a lock-in amplifier, a material property, the Verdet constant, can be determined.
 
In the present work, ferric chloride and ferric nitrate solutions were prepared at several concentrations, limited at 2.0 M by solubility considerations. The effect of additional chloride ion on the ferric chloride system was investigated using ferric chloride solutions made with set concentrations of sodium chloride. A plot of the concentration dependence of the Verdet constant revealed a linear response for ferric nitrate and a non-linear response for ferric chloride. The non-linearity became more pronounced with additional chloride ion present in solution. Raman spectra were obtained for all solutions to examine aqueous iron(III) speciation as a possible explanation for the non-linear behavior.",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

4/2/13 14:33,Home for Sale (approximately 1 mile from campus),"
Professor Eccles is retiring and selling his home in Terre Haute.  He is preparing to list his home with a realtor.  However, he is willing to sell his home directly to someone in the Rose-Hulman community.  If you're interested, please let him know before Wednesday noon, 4/10/13.
 

The home is at 609 Gardendale Road, only a mile from the Rose campus.

It's a traditional ranch home, about 1500 square feet, 3 bedrooms, 2 full baths, living room, dining room, kitchen, attached 2-car garage on .8 acres in Woodridge, a subdivision convenient to Rose.  The neighborhood is an established one, a blend of homes built beginning in mid-1950s.  This one was built in 1959 and has original interior features such as pink tile and pink fixtures in one bath, green with black trim tile in other bath, knotty pine kitchen cabinets and paneling in one bedroom.  The living room and dining room have hardwood floors,  hallway and three bedrooms have carpet (not new), baths have tile floors, kitchen has cushioned single-sheet flooring.
 
Upgrades since 1993 include new plumbing, new electrical wiring, new roof, new air conditioning unit, free-standing gas-log fireplace, termite bond, electric water heater, and pull-down stairs to allow for limited attic storage.  The 1993 gas range and refrigerator will stay with the home.  The Metzger-designed landscaped lawn needs pruning and care.   
 
The house was appraised within the last year at $89,000.
 
We can negotiate on having the washer, dryer, and riding lawn mower with snow plow attachments stay with home if desired.

It was on deep deep discount; I find the programming needlessly and frustratingly complex for my uses so I will give it away for free to whoever can use it. It is an Intermatic DT27 Digital Timer rated for ""15 A (1800W) Resistive and Inductive 500W Tungsten, 1/3 HP, 120 volts 60 hz."" It has a grounded male plug that goes directly into a wall socket, and has a grounded female socket for the device you wish to control. It will automatically adjust for changes in daylight hours during the calender year. You will need 2 fresh LR44 batteries to make it work. A 4-page owner's manual is included. Send me e-mail atjohn.m.gardner@rose-hulman.edu and I will find a way to get it to you.  ",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

You don’t actually have to be a chick, and the coolness of the car is negotiable. I will pay for gas and the ticket is covered. We would need to head down there pretty early (leave at 6:30 or so) to make sure we get good seats and everything, so first come first serve and reply ASAP so I can plan this thing and stop stressing.

5/3/13 8:45,Need roomate for summer,"

Are you looking for a place to stay for the summer?  I am looking to rent a room in my house for $50 /week plus one-half of the electric bill (estimated to be around $80-120 / month depending on how much you run the air-conditioner). You will share the house with my 20-year-old daughter. The house is an A-frame on a lake near Riley. It is approximately 10 miles, or a 15-minute drive to Rose-Hulman. It’s only 5 miles (about 10 minutes) drive to Ventures. If interested and would like to see pictures of the house, you can e-mail me and I’ll forward them to you.
 
You will have your own bedroom, and share the kitchen living room, and bathroom. You’re welcome to use any of the kitchen appliances and utensils. A washer and dryer are available. There is also a wrap-around deck, gas grill, and a dock on the lake with a fishing boat that you’re welcome to use anytime. I will be away all summer working in Dayton, Ohio. 
 
Call or email Dr. Deborah Walter if you want to see the place and meet my daughter.

The help I require shouldn't take long and may actually be quite trivial, but because I have no idea where to begin with Blender I thought it would be worth it to ask the Rose community for help.  I want to learn how to take a video game mesh file and create a 3D printer file (.stl) that I can use to make 3D printed models of objects in my favorite video games. I think that I am close to reaching this goal, but I have encountered a problem in the process and I believe Blender can provide the solution.   Read on if you want to know the details of my situation.  Currently, I can take the game mesh, export it as an object file (.obj), open that .obj in Blender, and export it as a 3D printer file (.stl). However, that .stl file has features so thin that the printer can't make sense of it and SolidWorks doesn't like to open the file as a solid body (SW says there was a facet normal problem, idk what that means).  I have an idea about how to solve this problem, but I don't know how to implement it in Blender.  If a Blender user could contact me (gehriccd@rose-hulman.edu) I would greatly appreciate it.

    Hi All,
    My name is Simon Liang and I am graduating in 2 weeks (sadly). Since I live on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, it is impossible for me to bring all the things back.
    I am going to sell the following items:
    1. Hanns.G 23.6-inch monitor. 1920x1080 max resolution and has 2 little speakers on it. It is kept in prinstine condition. All I have is a VGA cable with me now, which I can give to you, but you can always get an HDMI cable to use it too. I am asking $65 OBO for this monitor.Here is the newegg page for it and you can see the reviews for this monitor. (I think I might still have the extended warranty that I bought with the monitor from newegg, which extends the warranty to some time 2014)
    2. 20-inch Philips TV. I have been using it as a monitor and a small desktop TV for the past 3 years. It is also in great condition and I am asking $35 OBO for this TV. Highest resolution for the VGA port is 1360x768, and it is a 720p TV.
    3. Rosewill Cherry-MX Blue Mechanical Keyboard. This is a mechanical keyboard which I love, but I got another one recently and I am going to sell this one for $60 OBO. And for all the gamers out there, the brand of the keyboard really does not matter too much, because the key switches are the same. It is a little bit dusty and worn, but you can take the keys out and wash the keycaps and it is all good to go again (I can give you my plastic cap remover if you decide to purchase).Here is the newegg page and you can read the reviews (I got an older model so the keyboard cord is not detachable).
    I am attaching a picture of all these items. Of course there are a lot more things on my desk and if you are in deed interested in other items (Mac Mini, laptop, etc), we can talk it over on email as well if you wish.
    Here is the picture:

    If you want to talk to me about buying one of these things, or the prices of these items, please email me at liangh@rose-hulman.edu

8/22/13 13:49,For Sale: 2005 Saab 9-2x Aero,"
The car runs great and is excellent in the winter with its all wheel drive system, especially with the snow storms in Indiana. Although the car is branded as Saab, this particular vehicle was created in conjunction with Subaru so it is a Japanese manufactured car. Very reliable. Here is a link explaining what I am talking about (http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2005-saab-9-2x-aero-road-test ).The reliability of this vehicle is up to par with Subaru. I am graduating this year and moving out of the state. KBB lists a goodprice of$8550 but I am willing to sell it for $8000 or best offer. The car currently has 113,XXX miles.  -5 Speed Manual Transmission
 -Exterior Color: Black
 -Interior Color: Black/White/Grey
 -Sunroof/Moonroof
 -Power Windows  If interested, please e-mail me for a list of service history. I have been going to the same mechanic ever since I've owned the vehicle and have a record of every service performed.  I will be honest as I can here to save you time in the future. There are some minor dents in the rear driver side door caused by a sideswipe. It is not noticeable when 20ft away. The tires need to be replaced as well as headlights so I am knocking off $550 from the asking price. To save some time for those interested, here is the link to the KBB site to check pricing (http://www.kbb.com/saab/9-2x/2005-saab-9-2x/aero-wagon-4d/?condition=good&vehicleid=1524&intent=buy-used&mileage=115000&options=59247%7ctrue%7c59268%7ctrue%7c59296%7ctrue&pricetype=private-party&r=575259895529598000#survey ) I have priced it in between ""Good"" and ""Fair"". Like I said, the body work is not perfect but it is mechanically sound.  Overall this is a great car and has served me really well. Being a ""wagon"", there is a tremendous amount of cargo space. You can fold the rear seats down flat and have 2 people comfortably lay down inside.

Please see the full flyer with images, especially if this doesn't display correctly (http://goo.gl/Xab4HG)
 
Frustrated that your laptop doesn’t have an HDMI output?
 
I have a number of laptop HDMI adapters (miniDP->HDMI and DP->HDMI) and HDMI cables for sale. These allow you to connect your laptop to any HD TV, carrying both video and audio.
 
Here’s what I have:
- 8-inch miniDP to HDMI adapter (for ""Freshman"" and “Sophomore” Lenovo W530) - $10
- DP to HDMI adapter (for ""Junior” Lenovo W520 and ""Senior"" Lenovo W510) - $10
- 6-ft HDMI cord - $5
- 15-ft HDMI cord - $8
- 25-ft HDMI cord - $10
 
If you don't already have an HDMI cord, you'll need both the adapter and a cord. If you already have an HDMI cord to use, all you need to buy is the adapter.
 
I will continue to stock all of these throughout the year, so if you ever need just an HDMI cable, give me a holler.

Her fur is very short.  - She is in perfect health and very energetic. She loves to play, snuggle, and be pet.  - She's been spayed. She's had nearly all of her shots. The last shot will be administered this week.  - She does not get along with other cats. **Do not adopt her if you have other cats.  - Cats can live to be 20 years old or older. Do not adopt her unless you are able to care for her for the next two decades. We saved her life after she was discarded by someone. We want her next home to be loving and permanent.  - The humane society will charge a small adoption fee and run a simple check, to be sure you're able to provide a good home.

9/17/13 14:37,Galaxy Note II Review,"I've had the Galaxy Note II for over the summer and now for the start of the school year now. I'm quite impressed with it. The reason I bring this review to the campus community is because I've effectively replaced all of my class notebooks with my Note II. The Note II has a 1.6 GHz quad-core processor, an enormous screen, a stylus, and all of the hackability and rootability of the android operating system. I've also added a battery expansion to my phone, so I easily get a day and a half of heavy usage out of it, or two days of moderate usage. I can do almost everything on this thing from hooking it up to a keyboard, mouse, and monitor, to making calls, texting people, and playing Cut the Rope...   Attached to this sharepoint, I have a couple examples of class notes, as well as a picture I drew in a sketchbook app. If you're thinking about getting a new phone, I would highly recommend the Galaxy Note II. If you have any questions, or simply wish to fuss about me spamming on the sharepoints.. shoot an e-mail to weldonla@rose-hulman.edu ... Have a wonderful day :)",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

There are currently two RHIT students living at this residence. One is a boy and the other is a girl, both ChE. There is plenty... plenty of communal space... and just space in general. There is even a study room/office.   The location is 10 minutes away from school. The house is on Home Ave. This is one street East of Kroger Foods on Wabash.   Rent: $185 + utilities.  Utilities and rent usually make the monthly total for each person (3 persons) about $225-250 per month. This includes internet, cable, gas, electricity, and water.  It might also be worth mentioning that the house is rigged with a security system. It has a fully functional kitchen (uses gas stove). The house has a porch.  Also, there is a nice washer and dryer installed. Additionally, the landlords are good friends of mine so they tend to our every need quickly.   Let me know if you are interested. This opportunity could even benefit people who want to terminate their current lease with say, for example, VQ. You could be saving money in the long run. However, do not abandon your roommates.

10/8/13 16:03,Parkour Beginners Workshop Tomorrow,"
Hello everyone,
                I will be hosting a beginners parkour workshop tomorrow (Wednesday October 9th) from 5-6pm in the Quad. During this workshop we will teach a few of the basic techniques and attempt to answer any questions you  have about parkour.
 
A bit about parkour:
Parkour is a training discipline in which you develop strength, agility, balance, flexibility, and endurance by practicing fundamental movement techniques including running, jumping, vaulting, and climbing. It was  developed originally by the French militia as a form of obstacle training for efficient movement but has evolved to accommodate a wider range of movements since then. We focus on safe progressions of developing your self-awareness and mobility. Unlike the  common misconception parkour isn’t about jumping off buildings, flipping, and being dangerous. It is about safely developing your abilities and increasing your level of fitness through training safe movements.
 
A bit about me:
I have been training for nearly 3 years and been to several teaching workshops. I have been teaching informally for about 2 years. In this time I have learned many techniques of how to help practitioners of all  ages, skill levels, and fitness levels. I have spoken with several leaders in the practice about how to teach and how they have trained so that we can further develop the practice. I have competed in several national contests and placed in one of them.
 
I train most days of the week so if you aren’t able to come tomorrow but are still interested please email me to arrange a time to join or talk about the sport with me.
 
Thanks,
                Seth Rujiraviriyapinyo

10/23/13 9:15,Lee National Denim Day (II),"

Lee National Denim Day! was Friday, October 4, 2013 but since that day has passed, I’m making this Friday, October 25, 2013 Lee National Denim Day (II). What can you do to help? Wear your favorite pair of blue jeans on this day-donate $5.00 to Lee National Denim Day and wear pink in your support of breast cancer awareness. With your $5.00 donation, you will receive a nice pink ribbon pin to wear!
All proceeds raised through Lee National Denim Day will help the American Cancer Society and their ground-breaking breast cancer research and life-saving efforts in communities nationwide. 
*There are 2.9 million people in the U.S. today living with a history of breast cancer. (My sister is a two-year survivor! J)
*One in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime.
*One person is diagnosed with breast cancer about every three minutes in the U.S.
*In the U.S., an estimated 234,580 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed this year and approximately 40,000 are expected to die from breast cancer.
*One out of every two women newly diagnosed with breast cancer will reach out to the American Cancer Society for help and support.
Want to help? Please see Merry Miller Moon in A208, callx8276 or email at miller2@rose-hulman.edu

10/24/13 12:16,Looking for a home...,"
My daugther has 4 ""Fancy"" rats that she is no longer able to have in her apartment.  There are 2 girls (~ 7 months) and 2 boys (~1 1/2 years).  
 
She would like to have a re-homing fee of $20.  She has accessories and cages too.  She is willing to separate them but would like to keep the 2 girls together and the 2 boys together - definitely not necessary.
 
She also has Critter Nation (from PetSmart) that is perfect for all four of them but she would have to actually sell that piece of it - $150.

12/20/13 18:45,Open Letter in Support of HJR-6,"Below is a copy of an email I have sent to Dr. Conwell, President of Rose-Hulman, in response to the campus wide email sent out by Dr. Tilstra. I am simply using my right to freedom of speech to express my viewpoint on the issue. I made this an open-letter because I believe there are other members of the Rose-Hulman Community whose opinions on this issue align with mine. Regardless of your stance on the topic, you should let your voice be heard and express it to the institution's leadership before they make a decision on a public statement regarding HJR-6.  Dr. Conwell,  Earlier today, Dr. Tilstra sent an email to the entire campus regarding the Indiana legislature’s vote on House Joint Resolution-6 (HJR-6). She was requesting student, faculty, and staff support to convince Institute leadership to issue a strong statement in opposition of HJR-6. I wanted to share my viewpoint on what is being proposed so that both sides can be considered.  I want to begin by proudly stating that I am a follower of Jesus Christ. Being such, I have nothing but love and respect for all humanity, including those who engage in homosexual acts. Being a Christian, my moral values are firmly rooted in the Bible, and I would like to share a few verses that are related to the topic at hand:  “Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.” -1 Corinthians 6:9-10 ESV  “You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.” –Leviticus 18:22 ESV  “But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.” -1 Corinthians 7:2 ESV  The unrighteous acts described in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 show that sin is sin. A drunkard is just as guilty as a thief, adulterer, or person who practices homosexuality. The state of Indiana currently has laws in place aimed at preventing theft, adultery and drunkenness; and in doing so prevents citizens from engaging in sin. In HJR-6, the legislature is attempting to pass another law to help the people avoid committing such an abomination. The last verse, 1 Corinthians 7:2, is in strong support of HJR-6 and preserving the sanctity of marriage. All of these verses come from the very same book Presidents of the United States have placed their hand on when they were sworn into office.  If Rose-Hulman were to issue a statement in opposition of a HJR-6 as suggested, it would be nothing less than saying Rose-Hulman is in support of unrighteousness or sin. Knowingly promoting of a sin that God has deemed an abomination would be a terrible mistake for the university.  I am also disappointed that the institution is only seeking the opinions of community members who oppose HJR-6 without even considering the students, faculty, and staff who are in support of the proposed law. Even if the institution members responsible for issuing a public statement choose to deny the existence of God Almighty and defy his Word, they cannot ignore the community members in support of HJR-6. Any such statement would not be an accurate reflection of all the individuals who make up Rose-Hulman.   Again, I would like to state that I have nothing but love and respect for all humanity, including those who engage in any of the unrighteous acts mentioned in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10. I completely respect Dr. Tilstra’s position on the issue, and the positions of other members of the Rose-Hulman Community. I simply request the same respect for my viewpoint.  Though I am very proud to be a member of the #1 Engineering School in the nation, I would be even more disappointed to be a part of an institution that is against the Lord.  Sincerely,  Gordon M. Hazzard Concerned Student   ",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

12/20/13 20:12,HJR-6,"While I know that by responding to this, I am merely enabling everyone else, but I would like to give everyone some information on this bill since it was not explained in Dr. Tilstra's email.  First off, know that gay marriage is illegal in Indiana and that this bill isn't going to change that. But by passing it, we are a state moving backwards while the country is moving forward. So here is my description of the bill as I understand it:  HJR-6 is an amendment to the Indiana constitution that defines marriage as follows “Only a marriage between one (1) man and one (1) woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in Indiana. “A legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals shall not be valid or recognized.”  This would also potentially have strong effects, some of which cannot be forecasted, on domestic partnerships, current marriages, human rights ordinances, legal contracts, and benefits for unmarried couples.  Some of the potential effects are:   - Prevent any future attempts to allow for same-sex marriage in Indiana - Eliminate health care benefits for same-sex partnerships - Eliminate legally binding documents for same-sex couples that are “substantially similar to marriage” such as wills and trusts - Eliminate inheritance laws from being applied to same-sex couples - Eliminate hospital visitation rights for un-married couples  These could even apply to heterosexual couples that have domestic partnerships or civil unions.   Here is a definition and explanation of civil unions found at http://civilunions.aclu-il.org/?page_id=41:  Who can get a civil union? - Two people can enter a civil union if they are: at least 18 years old; - not in a civil union, marriage, or another substantially similar legal relationship; - not closely related to each other (for example, not a sibling, descendent, aunt, uncle, or cousin).  Any couple, whether they are of the same or different sex, can enter a civil union. Some different-sex couples may decide to enter a civil union instead of a marriage because of the impact of marriage on certain federal benefits, such as social security survivor benefits, or on certain private pension or health insurance benefits.  And here is a description of a domestic partnership from http://www.cityclerk.nyc.gov/html/marriage/domestic_partnership_reg.shtml for New York:  Requirements You and your partner may register to become a Domestic Partnership if you meet the following requirements:  - Both you and your partner are New York City residents or at least one of you is employed by the City of New York on the date of registration. - Both persons are 18 years of age or older. - Neither you nor your partner is married or related by blood in a manner that would bar his or her marriage in New York State. - Both of you have a close and committed personal relationship, live together, and have been living together on a continuous basis. - You and your partner must be able to truthfully state an identical residential address on the application form for the Domestic Partnership. - Neither you nor your partner is currently in another Domestic Partnership or has been registered as a member of another Domestic Partnership within the last six months.  As you can see, neither definition says that civil unions or domestic partnerships are solely for homosexual couples. And now that I defined those, know that this bill is not a matter of religion. It is a matter of civil rights and marriage under the legal terms. If this bill fails it has no affect on any sect of religion.  Now to address other things that have been said. I know that many read the bible to say that homosexuality is a sin, but the bible also says to love the person not the sin. So if you call yourself a true Christian you shouldn't care if gives benefits to people. And I can say this. I was raised Catholic, and you all can hate on Catholics all you want, but I am still Christian and believe in God and Christ and I tried to live my life as they want. But here's the thing I have trouble believing, that God, as loving, caring, and forgiving as He is, would ever condemn someone for being who He made them. God made every single one of us and being scientists and engineers we should know by now that homosexuality is not a choice. It is biological and has something to do with the way our brain functions and it has been proven. So you cannot say that God would condemn every homosexual He made to hell for being who He made them. To me, it seems to be a greater sin to not be who He made because each and every single one of us has purpose that He gave and how will we ever achieve that if we pretend to be something we are not. We would be lying to ourselves and telling Him that He did not make us as we should have been.  You can quote all you want from the Bible saying that homosexuality is a sin, but you can also find support to show that many of the other things we do in life are sins as well, but we choose to ignore those. Why? It's context. The Bible was written at different time and in a different culture. The Bible was meant for us be a lesson and not to be taken literally. Otherwise I'm sure everyone would go to hell. Stop picking and choosing what you read from the Bible because it doesn't make you Christian it makes a hypocrite. To show this variation, I have my Bible and the same versus quoted earlier saying those who engage in homosexual acts will not inherit the kingdom of God reads as follows in mine:  ""Do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived! Fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, sodomites, thieves, the greedy, drunkards, revilers, robbers - none of these will inherit the kingdom of God."" Corinthians 6:9-10  So I'm done. I'm sorry for those of you who have read this and prefer not to hear about religious things, but it did need addressed and not in the typically way of attacking religion. Everyone forgets that no matter what our beliefs we all have different ones. So stop trying to shove your religion down other people's throats. If you don't agree, say that don't bring religion into unless someone asks why you don't agree and definitely don't share it with all of campus because most of us don't care. Have your opinion, say you don't agree, but please leave it at that because anything else is going to cause problems. No one wants to hear they are going to hell because they are who they are and that might not even be their belief. We are all people and so take into consideration what you are saying and how it might hurt others because when people are hurt they will lash out and is that really what you want.  I'm done now. Again I'm sorry to some of you. If you disagree with me fine and if you feel the need to share your opinion go right on ahead but think before you do. I on the other hand will not read or say anything else. This for me stops here. And I hope most of you feel the same.",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal
12/20/13 20:30,Tolerance at Rose-Hulman,"The Rose-Hulman community is home to individuals of a wide variety of religious and political beliefs. Although we disagree on many issues, it is important that we still respect each other as adults, even when we disagree. This is, in fact, an informal definition of tolerance. A counterexample to this would be to using a religious slur against a Christian who does not support HJR-6.  The definition of marriage is a hot button issue in the United States, which is what HJR-6 is concerned with. Earlier today, Dr. Tilstra sent out a campus-wide email seeking signatures for a letter that reads as follows:  “It is the opinion of the undersigned members of Rose-Hulman’s faculty, staff, and student body that Institute leadership should issue a strong statement in opposition to HJR-6.”  Regardless of where you stand on this issue, ask yourself: Is it right for institute leadership to make a statement opposing HJR-6 on behalf of the entire Rose-Hulman community, even on behalf of those who disagree? To those who oppose the bill, ask yourself: how would you feel if Rose were to issue a statement on your behalf, endorsing something that you did not believe in?  Communities are nothing more than the individuals that they are composed of. This is not about the definition of marriage, this is about recognizing the individuality and diversity that make Rose, Rose.  Thank you for your time.",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

The idea of Rose responding to HJR-6 was proposed as an action that would make Rose a more welcoming environment, but these Sharepoints show that, regardless of what side Rose chooses, there will be people who feel like their voice does not matter on campus. That is not to say that this is an issue that should be ignored. It is an important issue, but I don't believe an organization that represents so many points of view should side one way or the other. If you feel so strongly about the issue, get off of Sharepoint and write an Indiana Congressman and let them know what you think. If you feel like you need a larger group for your voice to be heard, there are groups that support both sides of the arguement. Get organized and get a list of students who support your point of view. However, let Rose as an organization stay neutral so it can remain a welcoming environment for all groups.

12/25/13 23:54,Separation of Church and State,"“Religious institutions that use government power in support of themselves and force their views on persons of other faiths, or of no faith, undermine all our civil rights. Moreover, state support of an established religion tends to make the clergy unresponsive to their own people, and leads to corruption within religion itself. Erecting the 'wall of separation between church and state,' therefore, is absolutely essential in a free society.” ― Thomas Jefferson  “The purpose of separation of church and state is to keep forever from these shores the ceaseless strife that has soaked the soil of Europe in blood for centuries.” ― James Madison  “The government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.” ― John Adams and George Washington  ""I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute"" - John F. Kennedy  “The liberty of man is not safe in the hands of any church. Wherever the Bible and sword are in partnership, man is a slave. All laws for the purpose of making man worship God, are born of the same spirit that kindled the fires of the auto da fe, and lovingly built the dungeons of the Inquisition. All laws defining and punishing blasphemy -- making it a crime to give your honest ideas about the Bible, or to laugh at the ignorance of the ancient Jews, or to enjoy yourself on the Sabbath, or to give your opinion of Jehovah, were passed by impudent bigots, and should be at once repealed by honest men. An infinite God ought to be able to protect himself, without going in partnership with State Legislatures. Certainly he ought not so to act that laws become necessary to keep him from being laughed at. No one thinks of protecting Shakespeare from ridicule, by the threat of fine and imprisonment. It strikes me that God might write a book that would not necessarily excite the laughter of his children. In fact, I think it would be safe to say that a real God could produce a work that would excite the admiration of mankind.” ― Robert G. Ingersoll  And for Mr.Hazzard, this next one is my favorite.  ""The civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship, nor shall any national religion be established nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience be in any manner, or on any pretext, infringed."" -James Madison (In speech to congress when introducing the Bill of Rights)  I was born and raised a christian but have diverted from that faith because I disagreed with their practices (for anybody curious, I am also heterosexual). I respect every religion equally, but to bring your religion into our laws, into the government, and into the state is directly opposing what the great men who build this nation believed in. I, for one, will be signing Dr.Tilstra's letter because I believe that all people should be treated equal, regardless of their faith, believes, spirituality, sexual orientation, or any other personal choice. If you disagree with homosexuality because it is your personal belief, then create your own letter to send to congress. But don't you dare threaten divine judgement upon those who are not afraid to express themselves in this modern day and age.  Sincerely, a pragmatic student.",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

4/10/14 17:59,Selling Samsung Galaxy Note 8,"I have for sale a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Tablet
 This is the perfect tablet to take notes with as it is nice and compact. It is not as big as the 10in tablets yet has all the performance. The Samsung Note suite features a variety of productivity tools such as text, shape, and even equation recognition. I have been using this for about a year and I have enjoyed every moment of it. Another neat feature is when you use a remote desktop application the Galaxy's S Pen can interact with your computer. If you're tired of carrying your computer everywhere then this is the perfect device for you. The remote desktop connection is pretty smooth when you're on the Rose Hulman network as you can run programs such as LabView, Matlab, Maple with little to no lag. Also, this is the White, 16GB model with expandable storage. I am selling this because I will be graduating in a few weeks and won't be needing this device for the type of work I will be doing and would like to give the Rose community the opportunity to purchase this before I post it on Craigslist.
Here is a link of the specifications of the Note 8 tablet
To save you some time, this is an Amazon link with prices of a used Note 8
 The lowest price seems to be around $220, I am asking for $200. This price is fixed, no negotiations.
It comes with:
 original box
 a charger
 the S Pen
 2 cases
 a screen protector fitted onto the tablet

It has a single white LED with two modes, solid and flashing. You turn it on or off by pressing and holding the button for approx. one second. To change mode, press and release the button while the light is on.  The taillight takes 2 AAA batteries and has 5 red LEDs in a vertical arrangement and is about 4 inches long, 3/4 inch wide and 1-1/4 inches thick. It has several blinking modes as well as full-on mode. To turn on, press and release the button. To change mode, press and release the button while the light is in operation. To turn off, press and hold the button for approx. one second.   Both lights attach to the bike with quick release brackets. The brackets themselves attach with a hand-tightened wheel and strap, sort of like a plastic hose clamp. The tails of the straps have been trimmed but there should still be enough length to fit around most handlebars and seatposts... if it cannot fit your bike you can return it for a refund.

My name is Holly Brucken and I'm with PINK of Terre Haute. We are reaching out to breast cancer survivors to help us for a very special event!  (see flyer attached)



PINK has partnered up with Millie & Maude & Modern Charm for the PINK fashion show on Thursday June 12that the Indiana Theatre in Terre Haute. We need 20 breast cancer survivors/patients to be models for us!

Cocktails will start at 6pm, and the fashion/hair show will begin at 7.  Most of the salons will start hair and makeup by 3pm, and  the models go to the respective salons to do that.  Each boutique is pairing up with a salon to complete their look.

Each model will walk 3 times - a day look, casual or resort, then an evening look.  In between the first and second walk, the stylists will take a few of the models from day to night looks.

We want this event to be a time for our breast cancer survivors to feel beautiful and to be treated like a queen for the day. 



Please let me know by Friday, May 16th if you are interested and provide me with a phone number and email address so our event coordinators can contact you!



We really hope you can be a part of the event. We want to celebrate your life, journey and YOU as a breast cancer survivor! 
Thank you for your time,
Holly Brucken

I'm selling it because I rarely use it. It's dark brown in color with a dark brown fake woodgrain finish on the door. There are numerous small dents and scratches to the top and sides.... that's a good thing because it keeps you from feeling bad when you accidentally scratch it. The inside is faded yellowy white, with a few discolorations here and there. No noticeable odor inside. There are slots for shelves but no shelves of any sort came with it when I got it, so none are included. In the upper corner is a small freezer. I'm not sure how cold the freezer part gets since I never used it. The fridge part works well to keep your food and / or beverage(s) of choice cool. It does not sit exactly evenly on its four feet, but you can stick something thin (like fifty dollars worth of a textbook) under a foot to level it. $25 bucks or best offer buys it, and I can help deliver it if needed.

Cooking a whole turkey heats the kitchen once but yields multiple meals (enchiladas, turkey noodle casserole, etc.). Having a turkey in the freezer is advanced preparation on holiday meals. Turkey meat can be ground or diced and used as a lean replacement for beef. Turkey is delicious!  Why buy these turkeys?  These turkeys get fresh grass twice daily, live in a natural setting, yet are protected from predators. They exhibit all their expected turkey behaviors. They have a constant supply of fresh water, and are clean and happy. They eat good food without any growth promoters. The processing is done without additives (no salt or MSG), and they are flash frozen to lock in juiciness. ",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

I think we could all use some action, rollercoaster action that is. So here are the deets:   King's Island opens at 1000 and it’s a 3-hour drive, so we're thinking of leaving Terredise at 0630. That gives a wee bit of a cushion for, well, weeing. Tickets are $31 per person for a group of 15 or more, $44 online for individual tickets, and $60 at the gate. Depending on who and how many, car-pooling is definitely going to be the tactic in the transportation arena, unless someone owns some pretty fast camels that we could borrow, that’d be chill too. I’m down with camels.   Just send me an email at costonbj@rose-hulman.edu if you're interested in going so I can start to get some idea of the car-pooling situation.

September 20th
Indiana State Memorial Stadium
The Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure® Series is the world’s largest and most successful fundraising and education event for breast cancer ever created. Your participation in this event helps us provide significant funds and bring awareness about breast cancer to our local community. Whether you walk, run, volunteer or donate, your support is helping us save lives and provide priceless support to those in need.
Once a year the entire community comes together to Race for the Cure. The race is a magical place where people from all walks of life come together to celebrate the triumphs, memorialize the losses, and inspire those who need the courage to fight. 
Volunteers are needed for the Rose-Hulman team for Race for the Cure. You can pick up your registration form in the HSS Department Office, Moench Hall, A208. College team registration fee is $20 per person, plus you get a free tee shirt.  You can help make a difference in the fight against breast cancer several ways: Join the RHIT team! Even if you cannot attend the day of the event, you can be a “phantom” walker –register, raise funds, get a tee shirt, just don’t participate the day of the event. Be on the team and participate! Or make a donation to a member of the RHIT team! Or participate in Lee National Denim Day-which is Friday, October 3rd. Donate $5, wear your favorite pair of jeans and help in the fight against breast cancer! If you would like more information, www.komenwabashvalley.org or contact me, Merry Miller Moon, ext. 8276 or miller2@rose-hulman.edu  We can make a difference in the fight against breast cancer together!
See the attached document for information.
Thank you,

  I have a seven-foot tall loft that I am looking to sell.  It is meant to cover the back part of a lakeside 1 room.

  365 days ago, I hand-crafted this loft in my humble, tall, empty lakeside 1 living space.  A lot of money was put into purchasing only the high quality pieces of wood and screws from Menard's; each piece of wood was inspected carefully to ensure the longevity and stability of the loft. The upper level is supported by eight pillars of wood, and there are also some extra pieces of wood, if they buyer wants to make the structure even more stable than it already is.

  The price that I am asking for this one-of-a-kind, customizable, never-before-seen, #ThisLoftIsSuperAwesome loft is $200, but am willing to negotiate.  Please email me atchonge@rose-hulman.edu if interested, and I can send you some pictures of what the loft looks like.

Potential activities include:  * Weekly meetings to discuss new happenings in the world of cryptocoins - For example, the release of GAW Miners' new ""Hashlet"" model of ASIC miners.  * Occasional seminars open to all students, giving information about cryptocurrencies and handing out free ""paper wallet"" gifts that contain a small amount of one cryptocurrency.  * Coordinating a ""group-buy"" for a Rose-Hulman ASIC unit.  * Discussing possible applications for the use of cryptocurrency on-campus - For example, enabling on-campus stores (such as the bookstore) to accept Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.  If anyone is already involved in cryptocurrencies or would like to become involved, please email me at kuhnerdm@rose-hulman.edu.

 To the point - as of September 1st, Amazon released a new promotion, that allows people to earn $3 whenever somebody else signs up for a free prime account with their referral link.

 Now, I think that promotion is a pretty cool idea - but Sharepoint is not the place for you to rake in cash.

9/15/14 14:31,Chemistry and Biochemistry Speaker Seminar,"Allen R. White, Ph.D.  Wednesday, September 17   4th Hour  G315  Fundamental and Delightful Connections Between Mechanical Engineering and Chemistry  ABSTRACT: Chemistry is at the core of many mechanical engineering areas, such as internal combustion engines.  More significantly, measurement techniques that are central to chemistry also offer significant potential insight into engineering systems.  For example, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Time-of Flight Mass Spectrometry (TOFMS) give insight into combustion initiation and propagation mechanisms.  Conveniently, some engineering systems offer potential new applications in analytical chemistry.  Dr. White spent the 2013-14 academic year in the Hieftje Laboratory for Spectrochemistry in the Department of Chemistry at Indiana University Bloomington and will discuss these connections, specifically chemical analysis of internal combustion engines, and the application of an automotive spark system as an ambient ionization source for mass spectrometry.

Cryptocurrency Club will be a place for any student to discuss or learn more about various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Dogecoin. Yes. Dogecoin. Wow.


At this point, we need to get as many people signed up for the club as possible, so that we have a good chance of the SGA recognizing us as an official Rose-Hulman student organization. So, if you're interested at all about a new, innovative currency system that's been used for all sorts of business, economic, and charitable purposes, I strongly encourage you to send me an email at kuhnerdm@rose-hulman.edu, letting me know what days and times you are available for weekly meetings. I want to set a time that works for as many people as possible, so that everyone can have a chance to learn about cryptocurrencies. Thanks!

9/28/14 14:05,First Cryptocurrency Club meeting - THIS FRIDAY EVENING,"
​Hello, everyone! It's me again, that nerd that talks about Bitcoin a lot. I'm very excited to say that the first meeting of the Cryptocurrency Club will be this Friday (Oct. 3) at 7:00 PM on the second floor of the union, right outside the cafeteria, where all the couches are. We'll be able to reserve an actual room once we get certified by the SGA, but for now, that should be a good place to meet.


On Friday, we will be discussing info about the club, as well as getting a sort of crash course in the very basics of cryptocurrency. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE IN CRYPTOCURRENCY TO ATTEND. This is a place to discuss AND learn more about cryptocurrency. Also, there may be a few free gifts to all who attend...


Remember, the more people we get at these first few meetings, the more of a chance we get of being certified by the SGA. This will give us the ability to reserve rooms in the academic buildings and to apply for funding from the SGA. Plus, we'll be on the Rose website, which is pretty cool. So, if you have any interest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, or want to learn more, be sure to be outside the cafeteria at 7:00 PM this Friday!

They are holding her for five days and if  the owner is not found, she will  be available for adoption if anyone is interested in adopting her. She was a very friendly dog.

​A young (about 1 year or less) Male dog was found a couople weeks ago on the North end of town near SkyKing airport. He is neutered, black with a few white spatterings, clean white teeth, and SO friendly. Good with people, dogs and cats. We can't seem to find any owner although it is obvious he has been with people and kept fed and clean. Can anyone take him in? He is soooo sweet! I would keep him in a heartbeat, but I have 2 dogs already. (See the pics attached! or email for pics) Please share this! Text or email me 812-870-5086 ​",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

 Rose-Hulman has established a new partnership with the IU-Kelley School of Business that enables a student to earn an M.S. degree from the IU-Kelley School of Business in just one year after graduation from Rose-Hulman.

To provide our students with an introduction to the case study method used in graduate schools of business, we will be hosting a professor from the IU-Kelley School of Business to present a case study that examines BPs corporate strategy in light of their acquisitions of ARCO and SOLAREX (see below for more details).  Following the case study presentation, there will also be a short description of the new program that enables a graduate from Rose to earn an M.S. in one year from the IU-Kelley School of Business.

The case study presentation is scheduled for Tuesday, 12/2, at 6:00 in E104.  Pizza will be provided.  All interested students are invited to attend.

Case Study Abstract:

Industry: Oil and Gas, Solar Energy, and Alternative Energy Technologies

Client and setting: BP, early 2000s

Corporate Social Strategy Decision Point: How to integrate non-market forces (Political, Economic, Social, and Technological) into your market strategy in order to enhance profitability and competitive positioning. Specifically, in the early 21st century, BP made two strategic acquisitions: ARCO (oil and gas) and SOLAREX (solar energy). The Solarex acquisition made BP Solar the largest solar energy company in the world, likewise, the ARCO acquisition made BP the largest oil and gas company in the world. How should BP proceed into the 21st century given their positioning of solar vis a vis their positioning of oil and gas?

2/25/15 9:37,Cobra Mustang for sale - by Todd Warren,"
​We are considering selling our 1996 Cobra Mustang. It has 21744 original miles and has been garage kept since we bought it brand new in October of 1995 at Clinton Motorsports in Clinton, IL. I still have all the original documentation and dealer goodies that I received with the car when we bought it off the showroom floor. It is a show stopper and has been to many local, national and grand national shows winning 30+ awards over the past 20 years. This car is completely original with the exception of a new battery which I put in last year. This isn't your average '96 Mustang! It has a hand built/hand signed motor and is a limited production SVT Cobra Mustang. It was the top of the line Ford offered the year we purchased it.  We do not have to sell the car but have a couple goals in mind for the money we receive from the car.   The car is a 5 speed with a hi-performance v8.  It has been adult driven and well maintained.  It has black leather and is in perfect condition.  The picture shown was only a staging photograph.  This car has never been on the drag strip but it will do 0-60 in 5.4 seconds!  $13,500  You can call and leave a message at 812-239-1456.  Ask for Todd  to see the car or get more info.  Serious inquiries only.​",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

The Integration of a 3-Electrode System into a Microfluidic Detection Device
Microfluidic devices show great promise for the advancement of chemical measurements in terms of control, sample size, and portability. Currently they are used for a variety of applications in both the chemical and biomedical fields; however, most of the devices currently manufactured require specialized equipment and high costs for manufacturing. This work aims to provide an alternative to expensive photolithographic fabrication techniques while at the same time integrating a 3-electrode detection system into a microfluidic device. Electrochemical detection (ECD) is desirable because it allows for the sensitive and selective analysis of redox-active chemical systems. In this work, microfluidic channels were etched into acrylic plates using an automated laser etching system. A carbon cryogel working electrode was integrated successfully into the microfluidic channel. A Ag/AgCl reference electrode prepared by coating a Ag wire with AgCl using a bleach solution was also prepared for integration into the device. The third electrode was a Pt auxiliary (counter) electrode. The feasibility of ECD using the embedded carbon cryogel electrode was demonstrated by detecting 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), within the microfluidic channel using pulsed waveform voltammetry. 8-OH-dG is a biologically relevant biomarker for oxidative DNA damage. Moving forward, the integration of all 3 electrodes into a detection system for a microfluidic device is looking very promising. When this integration has been completed, this detection system could be combined with other devices used for separations or reactions to monitor the concentrations of chemicals within systems. Another possible application includes point of care monitoring in medical testing.",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

I lost a green uni ball jetstream 4-in-1 pen earlier today, presumably in Olin, around O257, probably at about 1:30 or so. It has 4 ink colors (black, blue, red, and green) as well as a pencil. There shouldn't be an eraser in the top part of the pen. Also there is an image of a tower in white near the grip. The pen has some sentimental value so if you found it, I'd appreciate it if you return it. You can send it to CM 2839 if found. ​",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

​Hey Seniors: Planning to upgrade your laptop after you leave Rose? Don't quite know what to do with the worn-out one you have now? Want to make it part of something awesome?

Turns out our laptops have a decent bit of power, especially in the dedicated Quattro GPU's. I'm trying to set up a compact, energy efficient beowulf cluster using as many of our laptops as possible. The end goal is for it to serve as a playground for  parallel processing and CUDA programming. Problem is, I'm a college student, and asking for a remotely reasonable price for 16 or 32 laptops is more money than I can handle. To that end, I'm asking for donations.

In return for a donated laptop, I will set you up a SSH account on the head node of the cluster and keep you up-to-date on its status until I take it down. I will also give you more permanent contact information so that we can keep in touch after graduation.

And since my mind just loves going off on tangents, I am also at the point where I am willing to take any offer for the University Physics textbook (looseleaf) that I have, so if anyone is interested feel free to name a price anywhere above $0 and (assuming anyone is interested) I will inform the highest offer by 9am tomorrow.

9/1/15 18:05,Selling one person loft!,"
Do you want a loft but your roommate is generally opposed to the issue of cost and effort? Get a one person loft!
 
Description:
 The loft is assembled entirely with bolts, ensuring a secure connection that has not fatigued over time and takes up a little more space than one bed. It provides a second desk for additional work space that fits perfectly within the loft dimensions and all of it was first virtually made in a CAD file to ensure proper fitting dimensions and structural integrity. The loft structure will not sway or shift no matter how reckless as you are given that it is only your body weight affecting the loft.
 
Pictures of the loft are attached.
It should be noted not all of that which is in the pictures is included. It includes the second desk and the under level lights (not the desk lamp). The giant whiteboard for standing work and tutoring is not included nor is the hammock and arm railing as it has been discovered that they are more trouble than they are worth.

I'm asking $150 for the loft, less than the cost of all the materials involved in the loft (ex. Acrylic desk top on second desk and rope lighting) and I will come help assemble it for whoever wishes to buy it. The loft was designed around a triplet's room but it will fit in any dorm.",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

9/3/15 16:35,First Zombies game Sept. 11th,"

Our first game this year will be sept. 11th, opening presentation starting at 7pm in the Kahn room next to the ARA. The game should last until about midnight. Squad size will be 4 people.
I know many of you are inexperienced, so a couple of things for all the new playersYou don't need 3 other people to play. Most squads are formed at beginning of the game with other players.

You don't need a nerf gun to play. We have several nerf guns you can rent for free. Just bring your student ID as a security deposit. However, rental ammo is limited, so consider buying extra nerf darts if you don't want to have to conserve ammo.

You are not committed to the entire game. While we would like you to play all the way through, you can stop playing at any time.

Try not to bring anything you really don't want to lose. You will run a lot and it is high adrenaline, so things in your pockets may fall out. Specifically wallets and cell phones are probably best left at home, unless you plan on using them.

Melee weapons are not allowed.

Laser pointers are not allowed.

You cannot keep your stuff in the Kahn room after the presentation. Anything left after the game starts will be moved to East 102 where you can pick it up. If you live on campus, spend the first few minutes of the game putting stuff like backpacks back in your rooms.

Modded nerf guns that hurt badly or look like real guns will be banned. If there is any question, please bring the gun beforehand to East 102 for me to look at, so as to avoid us having to ban your gun right before the game.

Hello everyone,
​I received a few complaints about the affordability of my services. I want to explain that I get  parts from reputable distributors. ​ There are cheaper options availble. You can get a 5s screen for $30 on ebay, but my friend who owns a shop  told me not to buy ebay parts . To be honest, I have bought $30 screen and it worked okay. 

So if you don't want to spend a lot of money on your older devices, you can buy screens from ebay and I only charge $15 for labor.  But sorry I can't  hold accountability if the parts fail.

READ –
I am close friends with the business owner of Top Guns here in Terre Haute. His name is Steve Ellis. He has a very interesting task for a potential new employee, maybe even two employees. He is in need of someone to manage his social technology and its design. This includes, but is not limited to, his company website, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube channel, etc. This also comprises filming videos and making video edits. I should also mention ""creative edits"" with creative editing software. This application has no limits. I will attach an example video from his YouTube channel as a taste. If you wish to see more, then subscribe and continue surfing. These videos provide a good example of some of things he is looking for. I should also mention this is an excellent opportunity to learn about gun safety, Steve is an expert.
Email him atInfo@indianatopguns.com
Don't just say you are interested, but include why. He is not just looking for anyone, but someone who can get creative with current ideas and future ones. I should also mention if you are a freshman he is particularly interested in you because you will be around longer than say, a senior. However, skill is skill. Enjoy

Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure® Series is the world's largest and most successful education and fundraising event for breast cancer ever created.
The event raises significant funds and awareness for the breast cancer movement, celebrates breast cancer survivorship and honors those who have lost their battle with the disease.
This Race is unique in the fact that 100% of the net proceeds are allocated to our mission. 75 percent of the net income stays in our community to help fund local programs offering breast health education and breast cancer screening and treatment. The remaining 25 percent of the net income supports the Susan G. Komen® Grants Program.
Join the Rose-Hulman collegiate team!  You can join for only $10.00 and you get a free tee shirt with your participation.  Click on the link below and click on 'register' and then click on 'Join a team'.  Search for 'Rose-Hulman'. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or need assistance in registering.  You can help the cause even if you cannot attend the race, you can make a donation to 'Race for the Cure'.

Supramolecular Surface Assemblies: Ion Binding, Electric Field Perturbations, and Self-Association 
Brandon E. Hirsch 
Department of Chemistry, Indiana University 
behirsch@indiana.edu 
Self-assembly has emerged as a versatile strategy to engineer complex, organic nanostructures at surfaces with high fidelity. However, most synthetic assemblies lack the adaptive functionality that is common in their biological counterparts. We demonstrate the formation of several stimuli-responsive surface assemblies using synthetically programmed components with known host-guest recognition properties. Anionic guests are used to drive reversible phase switching, template bilayer growth, and regulate multilayer growth. Scanning tunneling microscopy provides submolecular resolution of individual anion binding and self-association events. The charged nature of the guests allows predictable control of phase switching using the electric field from the scanning tip. Overall, this work highlights the use of molecular design to develop functional components that are organized hierarchically on a surface to yield adaptive properties.

It works better in terms of gaming compared to the school computer and can run most games smoothly, although it may not be the ultimate gaming device. This computer also has a SSD slot so you can make it run even faster. You may also buy a optional fan to replace the disc drive for better cooling, otherwise you can use a cooling pad to make it run overclocked fulltime.


I am selling it at around $600 (a bit more than half the original price) since it has some scratches and I have been using it for more than a year. Concidering it is still a very competitive gaming computer for its price, I probably will not go under $550.

10/25/15 22:32,Winter is coming...and I need a place because I'm homeless,"
​The name’s Bruce.  I’m looking for a new place/roommate(s) for the winter and spring quarters (possibly summer as well).  As you have already observed I’m sure, it’s getting cold outside and my current campground in the woods around campus is starting to get a bit chilly, which isn’t all bad because the cold has drastically reduced deer tick movement.  Sharing my sleeping log with squirrels didn’t turn out to be as warm as I thought (squirrels are small, thermal mass, science etcetera), and they tend to hide their nuts in my trousers.  I wouldn’t mind this so much but they can get confused when they return for a snack.  This is not pleasant. 

Harvesting down feathers from live geese has also proved difficult.  They are not as generous as they appear.  Their personalities are downright fowl.  Plus, as it turns out, coyotes seem to be somewhat territorial.  They are canine, so when they came to evict me from my pad of mossy earth with their huffing and puffing, I contracted kennel cough.  Luckily though, I had a couple of trouser squirrels that I was able to fend them off with.  However, their message was received loud and clear so I need to get gettin.  They’re kind of the thugs of the woods, so I’m sure they will return with more cronies next time. I know what you’re thinking, “Bruce, why don’t you just move up into the trees in a treehouse or something and leaf the coyotes on the ground?”  Well, I considered this, but I don’t want to get in trouble from Rose for treeson.  And if I damage/kill a tree during the construction of my oak abode, I could get charged with arbortion.  

 For my potential roommates, no need to worry about the kennel cough.  I got all my shots and vaccines with papers to prove it.  I know a very thorough, local veterinarian.  You probably have seen him actually.  He spends a lot of time outside the entrance/exit to Walmart holding a cardboard sign and asking for money.  A very generous fellow as I think he donates the collected funds to PETA. 

 Anyway, I’d prefer sharing a place with someone (human) to cut down on costs.  Until my professional shoe tying business takes off I won’t have an excess of funds, but I can make it work now.  My time in the woods has made me a fairly tranquil and serene individual (learned a lot from the surprisingly wise dumpster raccoons), so I’m pretty easy to get along with.

Shoot me an email at costonbj@rose-hulman.edu or text at 219-369-3191.  Or you can give your reply to the squirrel that's missing his left ear and both his big toes (Vietnam was harsh).  His name's Steve.  He's a regular at my log.   I know he looks kinda rough but just tell him you have a message for Bruce and he'll know what to do.  Just don't hold eye contact for longer than 3 seconds.  He can be a bit nutty sometimes.",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

Terre Haute Symphony & Masterworks Chorale
 
 
 
Saturday, November 7, 2015
Tilson Auditorium, ISU Campus 
7:30 pm
 
Fauré Requiem
Star Spangled Banner & Sibelius 5


 
 
 Guest Artists
 
 
 
The Masterworks Chorale joins the Terre Haute Symphony in presenting the shimmering and luminous serenity of Fauré's Requiem.
 
The concert opens with a rousing and dramatic concert version of Powers' Star-Spangled Banner that includes all four stanzas of our National Anthem. Featured last year in a front page article in the Tribune Star, this is the first performance of this patriotic work in Terre Haute.
 
Sibelius' powerful and passionate Symphony No. 5 continues our celebration of his 150th birthday and completes the program. This amazing symphony was inspired by a large flock of swans flying overhead at Sibelius' lakeside home in the mountains of Finland. Come experience the premiere performance of this work in Terre Haute.
 
All ticket holders are invited to a reception, hosted by Dr. and Mrs. Dan Bradley, following the performance.
 
This concert is a tribute in memory of David C. Mitchell, former THSA board president.

Alright, I'll make this quick. The wallet is black, fabric-y, inside's red. Most importantly though, if you look inside, there's a few credit cards, military ID's, all sorts of identification, and a whole lot of money. I... can stand to lose a few bucks, but a lost credit card can ruin my family's reputation and put me in more debt than I'd like to handle. 


Now about that reward, if you don't find any cash in the wallet, I'll do something special for you: Buy you lunch, play chess, prank someone together, etc. whatever your choice. But if you do find some cash dolla in there... You can probably put it to better use than I can. (wink wink)

He didn't have any family and no one seems to want to take his dog home.  A neighbor and I have volunteered to feed, water and provide winter straw for the dog  at our expense. However, since the dog  did live inside​ she now needs a doghouse to endure the uncoming winter weather. If you have a decent, solid doghouse and you would be willing to donate or sell reasonably for a good cause, please email me at martin2@rose-hulman.edu. Thank you and Happy Holiday's!",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal
11/13/15 10:53,Need Doghouse,"
Thank you RHIT community! You have been AWESOME! I have received several offers of a doghouse. I currently have made plans to pick the house up tonight. I should have mentioned that I included a picture of the dog on the sharepoint. I'm sorry about that, I thought it would appear as an attachement. She is a pit bull so she looks really scary. However, she has been a wonderful companion to my elderly neighbor ​for the past year and a half. She has been altered and I estimate she is around seven years old. I have received several questions about taking her to the humane society. While I realize this is an option, I hesitate to do that because of the stigma attached to the pit bull breed. Additionally, I really cannot say how she would interact with other animals or children. I worry about that and if she would end up chained to a stake in someone's backyard.  ​However, if you think you would like to meet her and possibly give her a good, forever home, please let me know. I will be more than happy to set this up. Just email me at martin2@rose-hulman.edu.
Thank you and Happy Holiday's! ",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

What is Forensic Chemistry All About?
Forensic chemistry is a branch of analytical chemistry that applies the quantitative and qualitative aspects with forensic evidence.  During the seminar, we will explore forensic chemistry and how basic fundamentals are used to identify, classify and individualize evidence.  Common chemical evidence will be introduced, such as illicit drugs, fire debris, fibers, and other trace materials.  A major difference with forensic chemistry compared to other chemical analysis is comparison and identification of the original of the material.  We will discuss how knowns and unknown are compared and specialized equipment used in forensic chemistry.  Lastly, then we will see how forensic chemists serve as expert witnesses and testify in a courtroom.  Knowing the importance of testimony, rules of evidence, and procedures in the courtroom is an additional knowledge that all forensic chemists possess.",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

Campus;


I am sending this SP because yesterday, I lost something at the football stadium. My partner Blair and I worked really hard all afternoon on these field goals, and I thought I had all 4 of them with me when I left. However, after I returned home, I realized that I only had 3 of them. It is very important that we find this last field goal; If we lost any one of these, we would be devastated, and our year-long project will come to a screeching halt. 


If you have seen this field goal, please let Blair or I know. Until then, that field goal will be sadly missed.

​Refreshments available.
 
Dr. Uwe Hansen
Professor Emeritus, Indiana State University
Introduction to Physics of Music, PH 290
*The Department of Physics and Optical Engineering is pleased to announce that Dr. Use Hansen will give a presentation in the GM Room beginning at 3:25 p.m. on Friday, January 22, 2016. 


Friday, January 22, 2016
Beginning at 3:25 p.m.
GM Room
Abstract
Musical Acoustics: Physics Principles Applied to Music and Musical Instruments
 
        Using a 3 m long spring, the phenomenon of resonance will be demonstrated, and that concept applied to some of the most important musical intervals. The spectra of a bowed string instrument and a clarinet will be presented and observations of the physical basis for the difference will be discussed. This presentation will be an introduction to a class offered this spring quarter, PH 290 Physics of Music. The class itself will be concerned with basic physics principles related to the nature of musical instruments as applied to key elements of musical instruments i.e. the power supply, the oscillator, the resonator, the amplifier, and the pitch control mechanism. The major instrument families will be discussed. In addition, we will consider electronic instruments, and basic concepts of room acoustics.
 
Dr. Hansen retired from ISU, where he served on the Physics faculty, and as chair of the department. Since retiring, he has continued to teach in the Mathematics Department. He has also served as Executive Director of CSUI, and as editor of the IAS Proceedings. He is a Fellow of IAS and the Acoustical Society of America.",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

Transitioning PLTL to Cyberspace: Mixed Methods Evaluations in Two Courses
The cyber Peer-Led Team Learning (cPLTL) workshops are a synchronous online adaptation of the educational intervention PLTL, in which students, under the guidance of undergraduate peer facilitators, collaboratively solve problems in small groups.  The purpose of these parallel convergent mixed methods studies was to assess the impact of implementing cPLTL in both a general chemistry and an organic chemistry course on workshop dynamics and students' performance. Statistical analyses revealed comparable attendance rates, distribution of course grades, and achievement on American Chemical Society exams for both courses.  However, discourse analysis revealed compelling differences in the problem-solving focus between PLTL and cPLTL general chemistry student conversations.  Similarly, artifact analysis revealed that cPLTL organic chemistry students displayed different curved-arrow formalism understanding than their PLTL classmates. Implications for faculty and suggestions for future research will be suggested.

Abstract: 
Polycarbonates are now widely used in applications such as sunglasses, fighter jet windows, optical fiber, and unbreakable lenses because of their low density and high refractive index. In order to explore new materials, a research plan focused on synthesizing and testing novel polycarbonates was designed. Using a variety of synthetic methods, polycarbonates could be produced by cautiously heating mixtures of bisphenolic indicators and triphosgene (or phosgene). After cooling the samples down, the chloroform solvent was removed by distillation. Then, films were casted. The characterization tests included optical analysis (IR spectra) and determination of other chemical properties.
Synthetic difficulties, safety concerns, and a growing interest in green chemistry, prompted a change in direction for the polymer project to a focus on synthesizing new environmental-friendly polymers. Biodegradable polymers have found a variety of applications from medical devices to environmentally friendly grocery bags.  They are widely used in biomedical applications due to their biodegradability and biocompatibility. For example, poly(D,L-lactic-co-D,L-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is a one of the most popular biodegradable polymers for therapeutic devices. This research was undertaken in order to easily synthesize and purify this material including new co- or ter-monomers  (e.g. poly D,L –lactic aicd - D,L glycolic acid - caprolactam) with the goal of minimizing production costs. 
Key Words: polycarbonates, biodegradable ter-polymer",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

You can even check which model they're selling here, and then buy the exact same one for half the price online.  If you have an older laptop that uses anmSATA SSD (usually junior/senior laptops like the W530--the W540 and W541 use anM2 SSD instead), I'm selling mine. The bookstore gave me the wrong model number last quarter, but I can't return it since the box was open--so it's completely unused. $30, and I'll even lend you a screwdriver to install it.

We live with 4 guys, 2 of which are graduating in May.  My friend and I are lucky enough to get an extra quarter at Rose in 2016.  We are willing to each pay our fourth of the rent for the WHOLE YEAR, but will be leaving after fall quarter.   This means you and one other lucky person will get this 4 person house to yourselves after we leave, but not have to pay additional rent.  
The rent is only $675 per person PER QUARTER.  This includes internet, TV, and water.  You don't have to pay for summer rent either, and there is no security deposit.  The house is fully furnished with everything except beds.  The house is off of Wabash, less than 10 minutes from campus.  We have a kegerator as well (fridge for a keg), and enjoy using it.

​My roommate and I will not be in Terre Haute this summer, and are looking to sublease our 2 bed, 2 bath apartment at Heritage Trail over the summer (June - August). Rent is $940 a month plus utilities (water, electric, internet - which typically aren't that high). This is very managable if you have a roommate. We will leave it fully furnished (so there will be a bed, dresser, bookcase, and desk in both bedrooms, plus the interior decor throughout the house). The apartment is located near Heritage Trail which links the apartment complex and campus (a 30-ish minute walk if you're not in a hurry).

4/11/16 19:13,Raising funds to work with Nobel Peace Prize winner,"
​
Hello guys,
 
I would like to share with a good new. I was accepted to participate in an Internship Immersion Program in social business at the Yunus Centre, a breathtaking institution developed by Mohammad Yunus, Nobel Peace Prizewinner, 2006.
​It is designed to help participants develop their social business entrepreneurial zeal. This program will give to me a grand opportunity to gain practical insights into the operation, management and social impact of these businesses through meetings as well as field trips to Grameen Bank and Grameen families of Social Business. In addition, I will have the access to social business study materials and will be able to attend a short course on social business where each participant will learn how to create a 'Social Business Plan'.
This program and this opportunity mean so much to me. Traveling to Bangladesh, work with a Nobel Prize winner will give me an amazing experience  that I'm sure I will remember and cherish for the rest of my life. Not to mention improve my ability to help other transform their lives. However, the cost to travel to Bangladesh and stay there is very high. My sponsor is offering me financial aid for the cost of the flight, but I'm responsible for paying for  meals, housing, and registration fees. This is where I could really use your help!
To achieve this goal, I'm realizing a crowdfunding that you can access in this site:https://www.gofundme.com/4cye5335
Appreciate anything that you can provide to help this dream became a reality!

​I'm selling my Yamaha DTX450x electric drumset. I bought it last summer, but must part ways with it since I'm moving into an apartment that won't allow the noise.

4/14/16 11:45,Free electric lawn mower,"
​Quite a few years a go a generous colleague gave me a corded electric lawn mower that had an electrical issue which I fixed. I used it until last season when rustiness​ on the mower deck started to make the handle unstable. I can envision at least one way to fix that, but instead I bought a new corded mower. So if you ever wanted to try an electric mower, or if you have some part of your yard that it's hard to get your mower into and you want a trashed out mower you can leave down there for the season, this might be what you're looking for. It is light-weight, very maneuverable, starting to rust to pieces and spews the cut grass out a side port. If you fix it you can get several more seasons out of it. If you don't fix it you'll be lucky to get through the summer before the handle falls off. You will need a heavy gauge extension cord, and you will need to learn to not run over your cord while you are mowing.

Polycarbonate Synthesis Using a Bimetallic Catalyst
Abstract
Due to the numerous applications of polytrimethylene carbonate (polyTMC), especially in the medical field, devising an effective and cost effective method for the synthesis of polyTMC is an important area of research.  In this study, two previously reported bimetallic zinc and magnesium catalysts were synthesized used for the catalytic ring opening polymerization of trimethylene carbonate (TMC).  Primarily, the effect of temperature on catalyst activity was examined, with a maximum conversion via isolation of purified polymer of about 67% at 90 °C using the bimetallic magnesium catalyst.  In addition to studying the temperature effect, the polymerizations were performed both with and without solvent in order to assess the prospect of implementing a more environmentally-friendly neat polymerization.  Recent results regarding the ring-opening polymerization of 2,2-dimethoxy-1,3-dioxane, a TMC analogue derived from dihydroxyacetone, will also be discussed.",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

Automatic transmission.

The exhaust is currently disconnected and cut right behind the front wheels.

​Abstract:
Examination of an Iron(III) Catalyst in the Ring-Opening Polymerization of Trimethylene Carbonate
 
Polytrimethylene carbonate (polyTMC) has many applications in the medical field because of its unique degradation characteristics. However, it is often synthesized using expensive catalysts that contain metals not readily available in the body, leading to costly separations and purifications steps in production. Devising a cost effective catalyst for this polymerization that utilizes a readily available biometal is an important area of research. In this study, a previously reported iron(III) catalyst was synthesized and used for the ring opening polymerization of polyTMC. The results were characterized using1H NMR and compared to those from similar zinc and magnesium catalysts.",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

5/13/16 22:07,Looking to Sublet Apartment for August Only,"
​Hi,


I'm going to be working for the Homework Hotline Ambassador program on campus this summer, and I'd like to find an apartment to sublet.
The job takes place from August 7th to September 1st, but I'd want to get there at least a day or two early and I could be out as soon as I'm allowed to move back into a school dorm (My guess is that's August 28th, but I haven't been able to confirm it) I'd really like to keep the total cost at less than $500, but going higher isn't completely out of the question. I'm not overly picky about the apartment itself. As long as it's relatively clean and safe I don't care too much if it has a washer/dryer, dishwasher, etc. (though those would all be great, obviously) I don't mind being a roommate, though I'd prefer the other person(s) to be female.



If you have a place that you'd be willing to sublet to me for August, please shoot me an email so we can discuss it. (rolfam@rose-hulman.edu)

Characterizing Metal – Antioxidant Binding in Relation to Metal Mediated Oxidative DNA Damage
Oxidative damage can affect the structure and function of tissues and cells, down to even DNA. Oxidative damage has been associated with some effects of aging as well as cancer and some neurodegenerative diseases. In metal mediated oxidative reactions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) react with metal ions, oxidizing the metal and, in some cases, forming an oxygen containing radical. The resultant product (possibly radical) may then interact with some other nearby molecule. A well-known metal mediated oxidative reaction is the Fenton reaction. In the Fenton reaction, Fe(II) interacts with hydrogen peroxide, which forms the hydroxyl radical, an ROS. A common alteration of DNA caused by ROS is the addition of a hydroxyl group to guanine. The modified base is known as 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) and is an accepted oxidative damage DNA marker. Previous research suggests that interaction of selenium compounds reduce the amount of 8-OH-dG produced by metal mediated ROS. It is believed that the selenium compounds act as an antioxidant by coordinating metal ions to reduce ROS production. The focus of this research is to study this proposed interaction between selenium compounds and metal ions. Two possible mechanisms are hypothesized; (1) the selenium compounds coordinate only metal ions that are free in solution or (2) the selenium compounds coordinate with DNA bound metal ions, forming a ternary metal-antioxidant-DNA complex. We employed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to probe the formation of Cu(II), Cr(III), and Fe(II) complexes with selenium dioxide. We will present preliminary results regarding the metal selenium dioxide binding interaction.",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

 Characterizing Metal – Antioxidant Binding in Relation to Metal Mediated Oxidative DNA Damage
                                                                             
Oxidative damage can affect the structure and function of tissues and cells, down to even DNA. Oxidative damage has been associated with some effects of aging as well as cancer and some neurodegenerative diseases. In metal mediated oxidative reactions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) react with metal ions, oxidizing the metal and, in some cases, forming an oxygen containing radical. The resultant product (possibly radical) may then interact with some other nearby molecule. A well-known metal mediated oxidative reaction is the Fenton reaction. In the Fenton reaction, Fe(II) interacts with hydrogen peroxide, which forms the hydroxyl radical, an ROS. A common alteration of DNA caused by ROS is the addition of a hydroxyl group to guanine. The modified base is known as 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) and is an accepted oxidative damage DNA marker. Previous research suggests that interaction of selenium compounds reduce the amount of 8-OH-dG produced by metal mediated ROS. It is believed that the selenium compounds act as an antioxidant by coordinating metal ions to reduce ROS production. The focus of this research is to study this proposed interaction between selenium compounds and metal ions. Two possible mechanisms are hypothesized; (1) the selenium compounds coordinate only metal ions that are free in solution or (2) the selenium compounds coordinate with DNA bound metal ions, forming a ternary metal-antioxidant-DNA complex. We employed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to probe the formation of Cu(II), Cr(III), and Fe(II) complexes with selenium dioxide. We will present preliminary results regarding the metal selenium dioxide binding interaction.",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

6/12/16 19:34,Ice Hockey League in Indy,"
​Hey everyone,
I'm the president of the floor hockey club and have been asked my some of the members to see if there is interest to carpool/group together and join an ice league in Indy and play once a week.  I know there are some students that purposefuly haven't joined the floor hockey club because they only want to play ice, so this is a good chance to.  You don't have to be part of the floor hockey club to join this group.
This would be for the upcoming Fall/Winter, and eventually Spring if this goes well.
​I have attached a Google Form to garner interest, and if there is enough, i will contact people moving forward.  Here is the email i sent to the floor hockey club,




Hello everyone,
 
I hope everyone's summer is going well!  Before summer started, Jacob Spears asked me if there was any way we could go to Indy and play ice hockey, and it would be fun if we could go as a group.  I told him I would send an email and see interest in the club.  Now, of course this survey is going to be skewed because we have not started to have freshmen join yet, but it will do for now.
 
The Carmel Ice Skadium is where we would play, and here is a link to the league,http://www.carmeliceskadium.net/adult-hockey/
I would probably be playing in the D league haha.
 
Please fill out the Google Form below, so that way we can see what interest we have moving forward.  This can expand beyond the club as well, as I know there are those who don't want to play/join the floor hockey club because it isn't ice, so giving this link to those not in the club but have ice interest is perfectly okay.  Maybe even a sharepoint would work.
 
Here is a link to the survey.

7/6/16 18:12,Selling Single Bed Loft,"
​Hello! I am trying to sell my loft I used freshman year. I lived in Blumberg, so it should be suitable for any of the dorms on campus. Like the title says, it's just for one bed. Both my roommate and I each had one. It's tall enough to fit the desk and dresser drawers under, and to fit a chair in the middle (this was the set up I had), or you can stagger the beds possibly in the corner with half the one bed under the lofted bed to create more space.
I am asking $50 for it, but willing to negotiate. I only live a couple hours from Rose. If you can pick it up from my house that would be great! Otherwise, I can manage to get it to campus, but I may ask for a bit more money to transport it.
My name is Morgan Dreyer. Email me at dreyermm@rose-hulman.edu if you have any more questions about it or want to see pictures!",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

​
Rumer Willis is coming to the Indiana Theatre in Terre Haute this coming Wednesday!
 
As the first concert of the new series, THSO Presents, she will present a spectacular cabaret/concert with her own band in a new set-up at the Indiana Theatre.
Here's what people are saying about her:
With a splash of sass and hypnotizing signature raspy voice, actress/singer Rumer Willis' sultry vocals and chanteuse aura melds her youthful energy with her charming interpretations of hits by Liza Minnelli, Billie Holiday, Fiona Apple, Amy Winehouse, and others. The eldest daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore dabbled in films growing up (Striptease, The House Bunny), but made a name for herself when she won Dancing with the Stars in 2015 and played Roxie Hart in Chicago on Broadway last fall.

7/22/16 15:30,Ceiling Fan w/Light For Sale,"
​​Ceiling Fan w/Light For Sale


I have a perfectly functional ceiling fan with light for sale. It is a Fasco model 978, which is no longer manufactured. The fan is in a sort of victorian style, typical of many ceiling fans, with five blades that can be installed either with a dark oak finish showing, or reversed to show a light wood finish. It has brass-colored accents and a milky-frosted glass globe beneath the fan which conceals a light bulb. I can send a photo on request or bring it to campus so you can look at it. When connected to your wall switch, the wall switch will turn it on or off with whatever settings have been set through the controls located on the fan itself. Those settings include light on or off (pull-chain); fan speed off, fast, medium or slow (pull-chain); and fan spin direction (small black two-position switch.) There is a moderate (but noticeable and constant) amount of motor hum and bearing noise typical of these sorts of fans. The noise does not sound like it is indicating any electrical or mechanical problems and becomes part of background noise. I do not recommend running it at anything other than slow speed to avoid vibration and wobble, which are typical of these fans in my experience. 


It is partially disassembled but will be easy to reassemble and install. I can provide installation directions on request. It was installed on an 8 foot ceiling and there was adequate clearance. Dimensions are: Distance from ceiling to bottom of glass light globe: 20”. Distance from ceiling to edges of fan blades: 14”. Distance from ceiling to fan blades where they join motor hub: 11”. Approximate diameter of circle made by fan blades: 50”. 


Since it is not a current model it is hard to arrive at a price. I see similar fans from about sixty to a hundred dollars at Lowes. Mine is priced at $20. If you want it contact me within one week of this message posting. john.m.gardner@rose-hulman.edu",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

8/2/16 13:01,Free Bed,"
Free Bed. If you are at all interested, contact me by 5pm on Thursday 4 August, even if you cannot accept delivery of the bed at this time. 

The frame is dark wood. It takes a “twin” mattress, 75” by 39”, suitable for sleeping one person. The current mattress was stored wrapped in plastic in a basement for a number of years and in my opinion should be replaced due to having a slight musty smell from basement dampness. If you want it you can have it or if you just want the frame I will dispose of the mattress. You do not need boxsprings, only a mattress, since the bed frame has a lattice of taut coil springs that the mattress rests on. 

The bed also comes with a “trundle bed”, a black metal frame that folds down and fits underneath the wooden bed and which can be wheeled out and popped up to make a second bed. This takes the same size mattress. The current mattress is in similar condition to the one for the main bed, and again, you can have frame only or frame and mattress, as you wish. Since this trundle bed has to fit underneath the other, it has a maximum mattress thickness of about 9 inches. 

You can take just the bed, just the trundle bed, or both. The bed is currently disassembled for easy moving. I help with moving and reassembly if needed, although I do not have a vehicle which can easily transport the bed. Reassembly is quite straightforward and can be done by one person.

​A 2005 Dodge Neon with ~113K miles on sale for $1500. The AC/heat work great, and the A/C was just recharged. The oil is always changed on time and it has recently been seen by a mechanic for checkup. It has a new tire on the back right rear, but the other tires were fairly new when bought the car last August. There is a dent in the drivers door, some paint peeling here and there, along with a crack in the dashboard. The door locks and windows are non-electric and the transmission is automatic. It has ~113K miles on it. Over all, it is a really solid car to drive. It has no mechanical issues and I have been driving it with 0 issues for the past year.

Acoustic 12-string guitar: $225
Shelving (glass blocks and boards): $10
Outlet strip: $5
One stick of balsa wood: free


Contact me at john.m.gardner@rose-hulman to purchase or claim


Details:


Guitar: $225
Takamine F-385 12-string guitar for sale.
The serial number dates the production to December of 1974.
This is a “pre-lawsuit” era Takamine, which tries to copy the look of a Martin guitar in terms of shape of head and style of brand name decal on the head. From a distance it looks like a Martin.
Top is spruce laminate, sides and back are mahogany, fingerboard is rosewood.
There are a few superficial marks and bumps here and there, but nothing ugly or obvious.
The neck is straight and, to my ear, the harmonic at the 12th fret and the string when carefully fingered at the 12th fret play the same pitch. I do not have an electronic tuner to test it, but with careful listening it sounds accurate and true to pitch when fretted.
The height of a guitar’s action is partly a matter of personal preference. I do not have anything to measure this guitar’s action with great accuracy, but I’d describe it as average, not noticeably high or low, at least based on my experience.
There is very moderate deformation of the top in front of and behind the bridge from the tension of the strings pulling on the bridge. It is not obvious, but if you look closely you can see it.
The frets and fingerboard show moderate wear.
The strings installed are quite old.
I’d describe the sound as “bright.”
This would be a good instrument for someone who wants to try 12 string, or who wants an instrument for occasional use.
It comes with a hardshell case typical of the period for this price range of instrument, which is adequate for careful transportation, but not as sturdy as a modern high quality hardshell case.
Depending on schedule, I can potentially bring it to the RHIT campus so you can try it out there.


Shelving: $10
This is a variation on the “bricks and boards” shelving that has been a mainstay of student existence for as long as I can remember. It consists of glass blocks and boards. There are 16 glass blocks and 9 boards. Each glass block is a nominal 8 x 8 x 4 inches. When set up there is 7-3/4 inches between each shelf, and each shelf has 26-1/2 inches of usable length. The overall dimensions of the entire thing once set up are 36-1/2 inches wide, 71-1/2 inches tall, 9 inches deep. You could probably configure it in some other fashion if you wished. Not all the boards match; five are thick and came from some sort of furniture, and the other three are dimensioned lumber. When set up properly leaning against a wall it is quite stable, although it should not be used in a space where little kids might try to climb it.


Outlet Strip: $5
Beige color. Plugs into the wall socket with a grounded (three prong) outlet. Has an on-off switch and a circuit breaker. Offers six grounded outlets. Length of cord is 5 feet 7 inches. Overall length is 6 feet 10 inches.


Balsa wood: Free
I would just give this to the thrift store but it would almost certainly get broken before it made it to the shelf and I hate to see things go to waste. Nominal size 3/32 inches thick (which, mysteriously, is listed as “.32” on the label) by 2 inches wide (actual width 2-1/8) with 23 inches of usable length left (it has a rocket fin shape cut out of the bottom.) Very slightly warped.  ",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

I am emailing the Rose-Hulman community with the hopes of starting a Pokemon Go community!

How Changing a Polymer's Shape Changes Its Behavior  
Mark D. Foster, The University of Akron, Department of Polymer Science
 
Because polymers are large chain molecules, the way polymer materials behave when they are in the liquid state depends on the ""architecture"" of the chain, the way in which the different parts of the chain are connected.  While we best understand ""linear"" polymers (those that look like snakes), ""branched"" chains (that look like star fish or centipedes) and ""cyclic"" chains (that look like rubber bands) are also used commercially.  The chain architecture affects both the way the polymer chains mix at the surface of the liquid and the way the surface moves.  In this presentation I will offer a glimpse into new synthesis methods for making well-defined cyclic chains and also introduce recent results on the physics of the surface movement.  Well-defined cyclic architectures are achieved synthetically using anionic polymerization combined with silicon chloride linking chemistry and metathesis ring closure.  Thermally stimulated surface height fluctuations on the polymer melt are studied with X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS).  These fluctuations, though of nanoscale dimension, dictate how the polymer liquid sticks to surfaces. 
For linear chains, the variation of surface relaxation time with in-plane scattering vector can be fit using a hydrodynamic continuum theory (HCT) of thermally stimulated capillary waves that does not account for chain architecture.  Assuming the theory is applicable, apparent viscosities of the films may then be inferred from the XPCS data.  For unentangled linear chains, the viscosity inferred from XPCS data is the same as that measured by conventional bulk rheometry.  The HCT does a reasonable job of describing the variation of relaxation time with scattering vector for long branched chains also, but only if a viscosity much larger than that of the bulk is assumed.  The discrepancy between the viscosity inferred from surface relaxation times using the HCT and that derived from conventional rheometry grows larger as the bulk Tg is approached and is different for each long chain branched architecture.  However, for densely branched combs and cyclic chains different behaviors are found.

TITLE:“Moduli   space – Geometry/Math with letters”
 
Abstract: We have a notion about when two   geometric objects e.g., triangles, rectangles, parallelograms, and ellipses   are similar.   Can we make measurements of the objects so we can exactly   determine when two objects are similar?  Such measurements are called   moduli. Collecting all the moduli together into a moduli space allows us to   talk about all the objects at once. In this talk we will start off with   moduli spaces of simple objects and then move on to moduli spaces of more   complex geometric objects such as Riemann surfaces.

Title: Structure and mechanism of deubiquitinases linked to Parkinson's disease and bacterial infection
 Abstract: Ubiquitination is a widely used protein modification in which a small protein ubiquitin (Ub) is covalently tagged to target proteins leading to a variety of cellular functions. Most commonly, protein ubiquitination helps maintain cellular protein homeostasis by providing protein quality control through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Mutations in UPS components are linked to neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease  (PD). I will discuss our current understanding of how mutation in UCHL1, an abundant neuronal enzyme that removes Ub from proteins (i.e., functions as a deubiquitinase, DUB), may lead to PD and other types of neurological disorders. I will also discuss our  work on a group of bacterial DUBs that help certain pathogenic bacteria survive inside host cells. Our structural and biochemical studies of these enzymes have given new insights into how intracellular bacteria manipulate ubiquitin signaling of the host to establish infection.",Item,announcements/Lists/Personal

Development of Paper-based Electrochemical Tools 
for Bioanalyses in Diagnostics and Preventive Care

Integrated Nanosystems Development Institute, IUPUI, 755 W Michigan Street, Indianapolis, IN. 
High-technology was critical to push progress in diagnostics, monitoring of patients, drug discovery and biological and chemical analysis. The past decades also saw a large effort towards low-cost diagnostics tools for point-of-care (POC) due the cost, maintenance and infrastructure associated with it preventing a global access to those hi-tech tools. Paper is available everywhere and although we use it less and less at home or in the office with the all-electronic era, paper can be an interesting substrate for scientists. Light-weight, versatile, flexible and globally available, paper is a good candidate for portable, low-cost and simple platforms that permit efficient and convenient analysis at the POC. One of the most successful POC device to date is the glucose meter. Electrochemical Microfluidic Paper-based Analytical Devices (EµPAD) were developed to interact with this commercial reader and applied to quantify various analytes (e.g., glucose, lactate, cholesterol) in blood samples [1]. Electrolytes imbalances measured in blood or sweat are also useful for health assessment as well as nutrition quality control. Ion-selective electrodes usually utilized can be fragile, costly, and subject to biofouling. We are generating micronutrients sensing platforms based on voltammetric solid-state ion-sensing, using potassium as first target. Paper can also support culture of bacteria [2] or 3D construct of cancer cells for compounds testing [3]. By combining culture capabilities and electrochemistry, we are developing electrochemical paper-based devices for the culture and detection of bacteria. Different patterning methods are available to generate those paper-based analytical devices, we tried to keep them as simple as possible with wax-patterning for example, but still achieving complex goals, such as organic synthesis with mixing and heating thanks to Teflon-patterning [4]. In our interdisciplinary research, we combine Electrochemistry with other area of Chemistry-Physics and Biology to generate innovative bioanalytical tools. Our objective is to improve public and global health through better diagnostics and preventive testing.Nie, Z.; Deiss, F.; Liu, X.; Akbulut, O.; Whitesides, G. M.

9/20/16 15:13,Shameless Fundraising Plea for Cub Scout Popcorn,"
All,
I, too, and the parent of a local Cub Scout who is selling popcorn.  I have attached a picture of the order form.  
Please consider ordering from one of our local scouts.  Over 73% goes directly back to the local scouts and they are doing amazing things for our community. 
I have some of the items already on hand, and the larger items can be ordered to arrive Mid-November. (Just in time for Thanksgiving Break - Consider taking some home to your families!)
To place an order, I can be reached by phone/text at 615-426-2740 or by email at bray@rose-hulman.edu, or simply visit me in Hatfield Hall, Room 204.
Thanks for helping our community grow!

Development of Paper-based Electrochemical Tools 
for Bioanalyses in Diagnostics and Preventive Care
Frédérique Deiss
Department of Chemistry & Chemical Biology, Indiana University – Purdue University, Indianapolis (IUPUI), 402 N Blackford Street, Indianapolis, IN.

High-technology was critical to push progress in diagnostics, monitoring of patients, drug discovery and biological and chemical analysis. The past decades also saw a large effort towards low-cost diagnostics tools for point-of-care (POC) due the cost, maintenance and infrastructure associated with it preventing a global access to those hi-tech tools. Paper is available everywhere and although we use it less and less at home or in the office with the all-electronic era, paper can be an interesting substrate for scientists. Light-weight, versatile, flexible and globally available, paper is a good candidate for portable, low-cost and simple platforms that permit efficient and convenient analysis at the POC. One of the most successful POC device to date is the glucose meter. Electrochemical Microfluidic Paper-based Analytical Devices (EµPAD) were developed to interact with this commercial reader and applied to quantify various analytes (e.g., glucose, lactate, cholesterol) in blood samples [1]. Electrolytes imbalances measured in blood or sweat are also useful for health assessment as well as nutrition quality control. Ion-selective electrodes usually utilized can be fragile, costly, and subject to biofouling. We are generating micronutrients sensing platforms based on voltammetric solid-state ion-sensing, using potassium as first target. Paper can also support culture of bacteria [2] or 3D construct of cancer cells for compounds testing [3]. By combining culture capabilities and electrochemistry, we are developing electrochemical paper-based devices for the culture and detection of bacteria. Different patterning methods are available to generate those paper-based analytical devices, we tried to keep them as simple as possible with wax-patterning for example, but still achieving complex goals, such as organic synthesis with mixing and heating thanks to Teflon-patterning [4]. In our interdisciplinary research, we combine Electrochemistry with other area of Chemistry-Physics and Biology to generate innovative bioanalytical tools. Our objective is to improve public and global health through better diagnostics and preventive testing.Nie, Z.; Deiss, F.; Liu, X.; Akbulut, O.; Whitesides, G. M.

I have 2 cats which are in need of a good home. 
The older one will be 2 years old in Novemeber, is spayed and has all 4 paws declawed. She is gray with stripes and orange spots. I've had her since she was 12 weeks old. She is a typical cat, she does her own thing, and is very playful.
The younger one is just over a year old, is not spayed, and has all 4 paws declawed. I've had her since she was 8 weeks old. She is a calico favoring black more so than orange or white. She's a very happy cat, purrs a lot, and loves to lay on your lap. 
As it turns out, I'm allergic to cats and I can't keep them anymore. They are both great cats and I will give you all the things the go along with cats (toys, litter, etc.) They can be taken together or separately.

Hey guys,
I have a Blackberry Bold 9700 (yeah...a pretty old phone) and I tried to call someone earlier today but couldn't hear them when I had the phone to my ear. I turned speakerphone on and could hear them perfectly, so I knew my phone wasn't on mute/low volume. I also ran a software test on my phone and had realized the audio test for the handset failed, which meant it was a hardware issue.
So if anyone is either an EE, CPE​, or someone in general who knows how to fix phones like Blackberries. would someone be able to help me try and replace this speaker for a reasonable cost?

The Ouabache (Wabash) Elementary P​TO is in need of help. Friday is our annual Fall Festival, with food, games, and a haunted hall way. We usually have more than 300 students attend. A group that had been scheduled to help us has had to withdraw that help and now we are in dire need of help setting up, running games, serving food,  and working the haunted hallway, and cleaning up. We are looking for help from 3 PM to 9 PM or any part of that time on Friday. We will provide dinner. This is one of our big events for the students and they have a great time. If you, or your group can help, please contact me. Thank you.

 Hello,

Our tech comm group is working to improve the assembly instructions used by the various campus groups who build bikes for Bikes For Tykes. We are looking for people who could test out these instructions on some disassembled bikes to test the quality of our instructions. You would just have to come down to the BIC this Sunday sometime between 9:30 and 11 AM, use our instructions to try to assemble one of our bikes, and then just answer a few questions for us at the end. The whole process should take around 30 to 45 minutes for each person. We are looking for at least 8 people, so if anyone can spare some time on Sunday that would be great.

We are mainly looking for people who are apart of one of the campus groups who takes part in Bikes For Tykes and has little to no experience in assembling bikes.

If you are interested or have any questions, just shoot me an email at pierceja@rose-hulman.edu<mailto:pierceja@rose-hulman.edu>.
