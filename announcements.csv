The Sagle Group At The University Of Cincinnati:  Single Protein Patterning Using Colloidal Lithography
 
Dr. Laura Sagle 
Department of Chemistry
University of Cincinnati
 
The Chemistry Department at the University of Cincinnati offers a diverse, stimulating atmosphere to carry out graduate studies.  An overview of the Chemistry Department and the University of Cincinnati will be presented along with some recent results on a new project in the Sagle group involving protein patterning for biosensing applications.  Colloidal lithography is a cheap, easy to fabricate, bench top technique, however, achieving patterning on small scales has proven problematic.  Recent advances to traditional colloidal lithography provide the ability to pattern on unprecedented small scales, ~10 nm.  This allows for the exciting possibility of patterning single protein molecules on a surface, which offers optimal control over orientation and aggregation for various biosensing platforms."

"Detox, Energize, Clear Your Skin, Get Healthy and Possibly Lose Weight","Hi Everyone!  So the holiday season has ended with lots of memories and gifts that we've brought back with us! But with all that happiness, most of us brought back a few things we could all live without during the holidays:  the stress, the fatigue, and those 3-5 extra pounds that seem to come oh-so-easily.

Being here on campus, it is easy to get caught up in homework, deadlines, family, significant others and activities and our health takes a toll as a result. 

I say its time to take care of yourself and your body. That's why I want to invite you to experience winter quarter differently than you ever have before -- to enjoy every single moment of the season without feeling that overwhelming guilt and worry that hangs over us like a cloud. Let's wake up after finals week lighter and leaner than you are right now! Let's do this together.

Entrepreneurship - Terre Haute Startup Weekend - Feb 8-10,"Startup Weekend is coming to Terre Haute !! February 8 - 10.

http://terrehaute.startupweekend.org/

Below is some information from the website.
----------------------------------------------------------
Ever wondered what it takes to be an entrepreneur?

Startup Weekend is a global grassroots movement of active and empowered entrepreneurs who are learning the basics of founding startups and launching successful ventures. It is the largest community of passionate entrepreneurs with over 400 past events in 100 countries around the world in 2011.

All Startup Weekend events follow the same basic model: anyone is welcome to pitch their startup idea and receive feedback from their peers. Teams organically form around the top ideas (as determined by popular vote) and then it’s a 54 hour frenzy of business model creation, coding, designing, and market validation. The weekends culminate with presentations in front of local entrepreneurial leaders with another opportunity for critical feedback.

Whether entrepreneurs found companies, find a cofounder, meet someone new, or learn a skill far outside their usual 9-to-5, everyone is guaranteed to leave the event better prepared to navigate the chaotic but fun world of startups."

"Climb tree, ride bike, play GLADIATOR BALL!","Are you tired of never having played Gladiator Ball?!  Well come on down to the SRC fieldhouse tomorrow at 7 PM and change all that! 

I don't need to tell you that Gladiator Ball is one of the toughest sports around.  I don't need to tell you that Gladiator Ball is a lot like volleyball in the way that it is played on a v-ball court.  And I'm sure that you are already aware that unlike volleyball, Gladiator Ball has a 15 ft gap in the middle, designated 'No Man's Land', instead of a net. And of course, as you are already aware, it consists of hurling a 12lb, beachball size, semi-cushioned medicine ball at the opposing team, scoring as the ball plows through the enemy and strikes the floor. 

Is this a sport for the weak of heart and body? Nay!  I say once more, NAY! Why should I waste my breath declaring that penalties result in 10 burpies for the player who beefed, when you already know this?!  

And why do you already know these things? Because you've been waiting for the chance to partake in the sport of bravery, the sport of valor, the sport of courage THAT IS GLADIATOR BALL since you were a wee lad (or lass)!

Here's a link of myself, family, and friends playing. 
https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151228488861378&set=vb.504156377&type=2&theater

Be warned: Gladiator Ball requires commitment.  If you are not sore the day following playing this, then you are made out of titanium, you're clearly a superhero, and should obviously be out fighting crime instead of sleep deprivation and anxiety disorders which Rose so graciously affords her children.

A bare minimum of 10 players is needed, but 12 works the best. If you are interested, send me, Bruce, an email at costonbj@rose-hulman.edu or text me at 219-369-3191 so I know we have enough fearless players to make this happen. All students and faculty are invited!"

I also have a 52"" RCA tv, that is a similar flat screen projection HD tv. This tv has a problem with  one of the color projectors (I think), which gives the image a pink hue. May be easily fixed, I don't know anything about fixing tvs though. Other than the hue, it works fine. Asking $75.

Abstract:
 
Consumer products have been pushed into smaller and smaller packages, and our processing capabilities have  increased due to better processing technologies (a la Moore's Law), but the quest for cool in the portable world is still burdened by the battery. Furthermore, Moore's Law has failed us and most ""improvements"" in processing performance have largely been due to slick advertising, and redefinitions, instead of true improvement in processing power.  I describe the trends in silicon-based scaling and battery energy storage as they are today, and what we can do to leverage existing technologies and methods to improve power consumption in the devices of tomorrow."

ECE Faculty Candidate Technical Talk,"On the Merits of Signaling Faster than the Channel Nyquist Rate
Yong Jin Daniel Kim
McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada
Thursday, 3/14/13 – 1:35 – 2:30 
D114
 
Future telecommunication systems are expected to support large data rates in order to meet the growing demand for data-heavy multimedia contents and applications. Currently, most digital communications systems are built to transmit at the Nyquist rate of twice the channel bandwidth, motivated by the simple transmitter and receiver architectures. In this talk, we will explore the benefits of transmitting data faster than the Nyquist rate of the continuous-time bandlimited channel.
 
The main goal of this talk is to identify the fundamental merits and potential applications of the faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling. We demonstrate that the FTN signaling can have competitive capacity benefits over the conventional Nyquist-rate systems in many practical scenarios, including the conventional point-to-point communication systems, frequency-selective channels, and multi-user broadcast channels. Consequently, low-complexity FTN coding architectures are proposed to explore the feasibility of achieving this improved capacity at a wide range of spectral efficiencies. These results indicate that FTN has a potential to become an integral technology for the next generation digital communication systems including wireless cellular systems, digital TV broadcasting, and fiber-optic communication systems."

Abstract 
Linear predictive coding is one of the most well-known algorithms used in speech compression and a number of various applications. In this lecture I will explain a subset of the applications of linear prediction, with classical demonstrations of its use in spectrum analysis and vocoding. I will also develop the mathematical foundations for calculating linear predictive coefficients and demonstrate more recent uses of linear prediction in health and wellness sensing from mobile phone microphones. The lecture is geared towards electrical engineering students, but is suitable for anyone with an engineering or computer science background."

IM Softball Games moved into SRC for Wednesday and Thursday!!,"Softball Captains,
 
Looking ahead at the weather for Wednesday and Thursday, the forecast does not look good. Both days will have temperatures in the low 30s/high 20s with strong winds. Due to this, the Intramural department has decided to move all softball games scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, March 20th and 21st into the SRC. Instead of softball, all games will be wiffleball. 
 
The game schedule will stay the same, meaning your team will face the team that was scheduled against you in softball. Game times will be the same as they are scheduled for softball.
 
These games will count in your softball team’s record!
 
Rules will be the same as softball (unless noted below), with 3 pitches allowed by a pitcher that is a member of the hitting team.
 
Additional Rules for games in the FIELDHOUSE:

There are no homeruns unless a batter makes it around all 4 bases while the ball is in play.
If the ball is hit fair and gets STUCK  in the net or ceiling, it is a dead ball and a re-pitch. This means the hit and pitch do not count, the batter returns to the batter’s box and tries again. For example, if the batter hits pitch #2 and it gets stuck in the net, when he/she returns to the batter’s box, he/she will face pitch #2 again.

Note: Every curtain, ceiling, light, or apparatus used to hang the curtains is considered in-play, meaning balls can hit and bounce off of these things. It is only a re-pitch if the ball gets stuck in such a place. 
A fair ball that is hit and rolls or bounces under the curtains surrounding the courts is considered a ground-rule double. 
 
Additional Rules for games in the ARENA:

If the ball is hit fair and gets STUCK  in the ceiling, it is a dead ball and a re-pitch. This means the hit and pitch do not count, the batter returns to the batter’s box and tries again. For example, if the batter hits pitch #2 and it gets stuck in the ceiling, when he/she returns to the batter’s box, he/she will face pitch #2 again.
A fair ball hit onto the balcony will be ruled a home run.
Note: Every wall, bleacher, ceiling, light, or railing is considered in-play, meaning balls can hit and bounce off of these things. It is only a re-pitch if the ball gets stuck in such a place

Wednesday, March 27
5th period, 11:45 a.m.
Room G315
Faraday Rotation, the rotation of light induced in transparent media by a magnetic field, is a phenomenon commonly used in optical systems.  In this presentation, the application of this technique to chemical systems as a probe of magnetic properties of aqueous iron(III) solutions will be investigated.  The theory of Faraday Rotation will be discussed, followed by a description of the current research and results.  By measuring the rotation of solutions at varying magnetic field strength using a carefully designed optical system with a lock-in amplifier, a material property, the Verdet constant, can be determined.
 
In the present work, ferric chloride and ferric nitrate solutions were prepared at several concentrations, limited at 2.0 M by solubility considerations.  The effect of additional chloride ion on the ferric chloride system was investigated using ferric chloride solutions made with set concentrations of sodium chloride.  A plot of the concentration dependence of the Verdet constant revealed a linear response for ferric nitrate and a non-linear response for ferric chloride.  The non-linearity became more pronounced with additional chloride ion present in solution.  Raman spectra were obtained for all solutions to examine aqueous iron(III) speciation as a possible explanation for the non-linear behavior."

Abstract:
 
This presentation will provide an overview of the OSHA and EPA regulations that many Chemical Engineering students will interact with throughout their careers in the Chemical/Petro-Chemical industries.  In addition to a historical review of why the regulations exist and their general scope a more thorough review of the three sections that new employees will be expected to interact with will be included.  This more in-depth review will cover: Process Hazard Analysis, Management of Change and Pre-Start Up Safety Reviews.  Through the use of specific examples based on industrial experience attendees will gain an insight that will allow them to better understand the regulatory nomenclature that they will face when entering the job market.

Sorry for the spam. I am selling two virgin mobile phones:

I am willing to sell them both together for $200

The Samsung Galaxy is fairly new and in good working order and I am including the instructions and user manual for the phone. 

The HTC One V is in a rougher condition but it still works quite well. 

Both phones do not come with a charger, but I'm willing to purchase one if I'm at the point of negotiating a deal.  

The Virgin Mobile network is quite cheap, and if you have ever wanted a smartphone, then I suggest purchasing either of these phones. The monthly price for virgin is only $35/month. This comes with unlimited web, text and 350 minutes.

	One in every eight American women will develop breast cancer throughout the course of her lifetime. As such it is one the leading causes of death for women in first world countries. The current forms of hormone therapy for breast cancer have a number of undesirable side effects, including menopausal symptoms and possible development of uterine cancer. The current question plaguing modern medicine is the mechanism for these side effects and how they arise. How can a drug that clearly blocks estrogen activity in the breast, activate estrogen activity in other tissues?

	One hypothesis is that another estrogen receptor subtype, known as estrogen receptor beta, is the cause. The role of ER beta in healthy and cancerous cells is still a mystery, so specific probing of the role of the receptor is essential. Key components of these investigations are a purified receptor for in vitro studies and a method for determining the binding affinity of known and novel drugs to this receptor. In the current state of pharmacology, radioactive and fluorescent based assays are commonly used. The goal of this research is to develop a method to produce the human form of ER beta in bacteria and then establish a protocol to analyze a drug’s efficacy on estrogen receptor β using fluorescence polarization."

Sabbatical Talk - Life in Zambia,"Life in Zambia
A Sabbatical Year Reflection

Dr. Matthew Boutell
Associate Professor
Computer Science and Software Engineering

Tuesday, April 30
10th hour
Olin 267

Abstract

Matt Boutell won a Fulbright Scholarship to lecture in the Computer Science Department at Copperbelt University (CBU) in Kitwe, Zambia for his 2011-2012 sabbatical. 

Rose-Hulman is a recognized leader in experiential learning in the undergraduate classroom. However, many schools in Africa use a more traditional lecture and recall approach. Matt will present his attempts to bring a Rose-Hulman style education to the students he taught at CBU.

Of course, much of what one learns when he spends the year abroad with a family of 7 takes places outside the classroom. As such, Matt’s talk will be infused with a healthy dose of photographs of various aspects of daily life in Zambia."

You don’t actually have to be a chick, and the coolness of the car is negotiable. I will pay for gas and the ticket is covered. We would need to head down there pretty early (leave at 6:30 or so) to make sure we get good seats and everything, so first come first serve and reply ASAP so I can plan this thing and stop stressing. You can contact me at baumbata@rose-hulman.edu

Thanks,

Free Iron Man 3 Ticket in Indy TONIGHT!,"Free Ticket:

Iron Man 3
Tonight at 9:00 P.M.
Indianapolis
IMAX 3D

Yours if you drive me there. I will cover gas cost. My brother was going to go see it, but needs to study, so I need someone else to drive me there. Contact me at baumbata@rose-hulman.edu if interested.

It's at 9, so we need to get there around 8:00 or so to get good seats, so plan on leaving at about 6:30. I need to know A.S.A.P. if someone wants to do this, because 6:30 is approaching, and other people are in on this.

P.S. sorry for sending another sharepoint, but it was brought to my attention that while I thought the previous message to be attention-grabbing, it was also cryptic.

Thank you,
Travis Baumbaugh"
Need roomate for summer,"Are you looking for a place to stay for the summer?  I am looking to rent a room in my house for $50 /week plus one-half of the electric bill (estimated to be around $80-120 / month depending on how much you run the air-conditioner). You will share the house with my 20-year-old daughter. The house is an A-frame on a lake near Riley. It is approximately 10 miles, or a 15-minute drive to Rose-Hulman. It’s only 5 miles (about 10 minutes) drive to Ventures.  If interested and would like to see pictures of the house, you can e-mail me and I’ll forward them to you.
 
You will have your own bedroom, and share the kitchen living room, and bathroom. You’re welcome to use any of the kitchen appliances and utensils. A washer and dryer are available. There is also a wrap-around deck, gas grill, and a dock on the lake with a fishing boat that you’re welcome to use anytime. I will be away all summer working in Dayton, Ohio.

Wanted: Skilled User of the Blender Program,"Hello Rose,

I am in need of the expertise of someone who knows how to use the Blender Project. The help I require shouldn't take long and may actually be quite trivial, but because I have no idea where to begin with Blender I thought it would be worth it to ask the Rose community for help.

I want to learn how to take a video game mesh file and create a 3D printer file (.stl) that I can use to make 3D printed models of objects in my favorite video games. I think that I am close to reaching this goal, but I have encountered a problem in the process and I believe Blender can provide the solution. 

Read on if you want to know the details of my situation.

Currently, I can take the game mesh, export it as an object file (.obj), open that .obj in Blender, and export it as a 3D printer file (.stl). However, that .stl file has features so thin that the printer can't make sense of it and SolidWorks doesn't like to open the file as a solid body (SW says there was a facet normal problem, idk what that means).

I have an idea about how to solve this problem, but I don't know how to implement it in Blender.

If a Blender user could contact me (gehriccd@rose-hulman.edu) I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks for reading!"

"Selling 23.6-inch monitor, 20-inch TV, and mechanical keyboard","Hi All,

			My name is Simon Liang and I am graduating in 2 weeks (sadly). Since I live on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, it is impossible for me to bring all the things back.

			I am going to sell the following items:

			1. Hanns.G 23.6-inch monitor. 1920x1080 max resolution and has 2 little speakers on it. It is kept in prinstine condition. All I have is a VGA cable with me now, which I can give to you, but you can always get an HDMI cable to use it too. I am asking $50 for this monitor. Here is the newegg page for it and you can see the reviews for this monitor. (I think I might still have the extended warranty that I bought with the monitor from newegg, which extends the warranty to some time 2014)

			2. 20-inch Philips TV. I have been using it as a monitor and a small desktop TV for the past 3 years. It is also in great condition and I am asking $50 for this TV. Highest resolution for the VGA port is 1360x768, and it is a 720p TV.

			3. Rosewill Cherry-MX Blue Mechanical Keyboard. This is a mechanical keyboard which I love, but I got another one recently and I am going to sell this one for $50 as well. And for all the gamers out there, the brand of the keyboard really does not matter too much, because the key switches are the same. It is a little bit dusty and worn, but you can take the keys out and wash the keycaps and it is all good to go again (I can give you my plastic cap remover if you decide to purchase). Here is the newegg page and you can read the reviews (I got an older model so the keyboard cord is not detachable).

			I am attaching a picture of all these items. Of course there are a lot more things on my desk and if you are in deed interested in other items (Mac Mini, laptop, etc), we can talk it over on email as well if you wish.

			If you want to talk to me about buying one of these things, or the prices of these items, please email me at liangh@rose-hulman.edu

			 

			(For future reference, if you are want to write a fancy sharepoint like this, all you need to do is go to website like http://www.quackit.com/html/online-html-editor/, and type your message on the editor there, and click on the ""source"" button on the top left corner and the editor, and copy-paste the source code for it. I would make some software that will do that for you but I got 2 weeks left so..)

			Thank you so much and have a good evening.

Anyone have a truck to tow-start my car?,"Hey everybody. My car seems to be having some issues. We've been narrowing down the problem, but aren't quite sure what it needs yet. What I do know is that while it won't start on its own, it can start if it is towed and then put in gear. This is like push-starting in concept, but requires less physical labor (as the car doesn't have to be pushed), and since I have tow straps, if anyone has a truck and wouldn't mind pulling my car up to speed, I would greatly appreciate it. This would be around 5:00 tomorrow, or earlier if I get out of my final earlier. Later is also fine, but I'd like to get going as soon as I can, so if you are available at 5:00, that would be ideal.

My parents have a beagle/bassett puppy that has been coming to their farm for the past few days. They can’t keep him even short-term (they have lots of other animals including other dogs which are not good with puppies) and are looking
 for someone to take him until the Vigo/Clay animal shelters open up hopefully at the beginning of next week. If you are willing to take in and care for this puppy for a few days or know of someone who could, please respond to Kelly Meyer at
meyer1@rose-hulman.edu as soon as possible!
 
The dog is very sweet and looks as if he has been cared for and has a collar, but has no identification or microchip.
 
Thanks so much!

I am holding a secret to Terre Haute living. I have a location passed down to Rose-Hulman students since 2003. What does this mean? The same lease agreement has been continued since 2003. Same price. Same rules. Amazing.

This entire house is filled with hand chosen students. The downstairs of the house currently needs one or two new roommates. 

The bottom floor suits four people. 
Currently, two RHIT students live on this downstairs floor. 

Total downstairs rent: $540
Location: This house is located on Home Avenue. (This is 10min from campus). (This location is directly next to Kroger on Wabash).

The landlord literally takes care of this house and the people in it. They want it to remain RHIT rented for life.

For Sale: 2005 Saab 9-2x Aero,"The car runs great and is excellent in the winter with its all wheel drive system, especially with the snow storms in Indiana. Although the car is branded as Saab, this particular vehicle was created in conjunction with Subaru so it is a Japanese manufactured car. Very reliable. Here is a link explaining what I am talking about ( http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2005-saab-9-2x-aero-road-test ).The reliability of this vehicle is up to par with Subaru. I am graduating this year and moving out of the state. KBB lists a goodprice of $8550 but I am willing to sell it for $8000 or best offer. The car currently has 113,XXX miles.

If interested, please e-mail me for a list of service history. I have been going to the same mechanic ever since I've owned the vehicle and have a record of every service performed.

I will be honest as I can here to save you time in the future. There are some minor dents in the rear driver side door caused by a sideswipe. It is not noticeable when 20ft away. The tires need to be replaced as well as headlights so I am knocking off $550 from the asking price. To save some time for those interested, here is the link to the KBB site to check pricing (http://www.kbb.com/saab/9-2x/2005-saab-9-2x/aero-wagon-4d/?condition=good&vehicleid=1524&intent=buy-used&mileage=115000&options=59247%7ctrue%7c59268%7ctrue%7c59296%7ctrue&pricetype=private-party&r=575259895529598000#survey ) I have priced it in between ""Good"" and ""Fair"". Like I said, the body work is not perfect but it is mechanically sound. 

Overall this is a great car and has served me really well. Being a ""wagon"", there is a tremendous amount of cargo space. You can fold the rear seats down flat and have 2 people comfortably lay down inside.

Abstract
Spectroscopic experiments at the Advanced Photon Source
 
            The Advanced Photon Source (APS) at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory provides this nation’s (in fact, this hemisphere’s) brightest storage ring-generated x-ray beams for research in almost all scientific disciplines.  Spectroscopic techniques, such as X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS), are a powerful probe into the chemical behavior of many systems.
 
This talk will focus on the source characteristics of the APS and the optical components and operation of a typical XAFS beamline.  A relatively new application of XAFS to investigate bimetallic catalytic systems under real working conditions will also be discussed.

Foster Cat Need Home,"Hello,

My wife and I have been fostering a young cat for the humane society. We've seen her through spaying surgery and all of the shots necessary for adoption. She's now ready for a good home.

- She's estimated to be 1 year old.

- She's small, approximately 3kg or 7lbs.

- Her coat is tortoise shell. Her fur is very short.

- She is in perfect health and very energetic. She loves to play, snuggle, and be pet.

- She's been spayed. She's had nearly all of her shots. The last shot will be administered this week.

- She does not get along with other cats. **Do not adopt her if you have other cats.

- Cats can live to be 20 years old or older. Do not adopt her unless you are able to care for her for the next two decades. We saved her life after she was discarded by someone. We want her next home to be loving and permanent.

- The humane society will charge a small adoption fee and run a simple check, to be sure you're able to provide a good home.

My wife has prepared a short presentation for your enjoyment.

Galaxy Note II Review,"I've had the Galaxy Note II for over the summer and now for the start of the school year now. I'm quite impressed with it. The reason I bring this review to the campus community is because I've effectively replaced all of my class notebooks with my Note II. The Note II has a 1.6 GHz quad-core processor, an enormous screen, a stylus, and all of the hackability and rootability of the android operating system. I've also added a battery expansion to my phone, so I easily get a day and a half of heavy usage out of it, or two days of moderate usage. I can do almost everything on this thing from hooking it up to a keyboard, mouse, and monitor, to making calls, texting people, and playing Cut the Rope... 

Attached to this sharepoint, I have a couple examples of class notes, as well as a picture I drew in a sketchbook app. If you're thinking about getting a new phone, I would highly recommend the Galaxy Note II. If you have any questions, or simply wish to fuss about me spamming on the sharepoints.. shoot an e-mail to weldonla@rose-hulman.edu ... Have a wonderful day :)"

House Roommate Wanted (Check This Out!),"I currently have a large bedroom at my house that can be rented (even has a remote ceiling fan/light). There are currently two RHIT students living at this residence. One is a boy and the other is a girl, both ChE. There is plenty... plenty of communal space... and just space in general. There is even a study room/office. 

The location is 10 minutes away from school. The house is on Home Ave. This is one street East of Kroger Foods on Wabash. 

Rent: $185 + utilities. 
Utilities and rent usually make the monthly total for each person (3 persons) about $225-250 per month. This includes internet, cable, gas, electricity, and water.

It might also be worth mentioning that the house is rigged with a security system. It has a fully functional kitchen (uses gas stove). The house has a porch.  Also, there is a nice washer and dryer installed. Additionally, the landlords are good friends of mine so they tend to our every need quickly. 

Let me know if you are interested. This opportunity could even benefit people who want to terminate their current lease with say, for example, VQ. You could be saving money in the long run. However, do not abandon your roommates. So, if you aren't happy with your living decision you most definitely should want to check this out.

Chemistry and Biochemistry Seminar,"Plasmonics in Metallic Nanostructures – A Correlated Approach 
Vighter Iberi 
Wednesday, Sept. 25
4th Hour, G317
ABSTRACT 
A large number of optical phenomena rely on the unique ability of metallic nanostructures to concentrate light on length scales that are smaller than the diffraction limit of visible light. Noble metal nanoparticles such as silver and gold have optical properties that make them suitable for various applications including solar energy harvesting, and surface-enhanced spectroscopy. These special properties result from an excitation of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which is a collective oscillation of the conduction band electrons. LSPRs are known to depend strongly on the size and shape of the nanostructure and can be excited by both electrons and photons. 
Our research focuses on correlating plasmons excited by light (resonance-Rayleigh scattering), with plasmons excited by electrons (electron-energy loss spectroscopy), from the exact same nanostructures. Our approach is twofold. (1) We are imaging plasmon modes in single nanoparticle structures as well as nanoparticle aggregates and correlating these measurements with optical scattering measurements and fully 3D electrodynamics simulations of the exact same structures. (2) We seek to image directly the plasmons give rise to the surface-enhanced Raman scattering in molecules and establish the location of the molecule relative to the plasmons which underlie these optical scattering spectroscopies. 
BIOSKETCH 
Vighter Iberi is from Lagos, Nigeria and received his BS from Campbellsville University in 2008. He is currently a 5th year graduate student in Dr. Jon Camden’s lab and is working on understanding plasmonics in metallic nanostructures using correlated optical microscopy and STEM/EELS."

Matrix-Isolated Infrared Spectroscopy: Discovering New Molecules 
Matrix isolation is an experimental technique which can be used to trap reactive species which are short-lived and difficult to be studied by standard methods such as X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometer. By combining the matrix isolation and infrared spectroscopy techniques, molecular signatures of these transient species can be obtained. Reactive molecules I am particularly interested to study with this technique have a possibility of being found in space. With unique signatures of the potential interstellar molecules identified in the laboratory, astrochemists can search for radio signals emitted by these molecules from space by using a radio telescope. In this talk, I will describe the experimental method and discuss the importance of this research."

Mini MOOC -  Humanizing Online Courses,"Faculty may be interested in registering for the 'mini-MOOC' linked below, on Humanizing Online Courses. 
 
 The course objectives are:
·         Learn how to integrate educational technology tools into an online course with an emphasis on technology that can create an instructor presence or increase personal interaction.
·         Share insights and suggestions about how to “humanize” online courses by maximizing the use of flexible educational technology tools.
·         Demonstrate how technology-facilitated interactions can make instructors and learners more ""real"" online and how this correlates with student learning and retention.
Notes:
1.  It's a short course – it only runs Oct. 21 to Nov. 25.  Low time commitment.
2.  It's free, and we can drop out or stop participating at any time.  
3.  If it's good, we have something to imitate in our own courses; if it's bad we can drop out and avoid imitating it in our own courses.  We learn something either way.
4.  Connecting with our students is an important part of teaching at Rose-Hulman, and this course may give us ideas for creating personal connections in new ways, online.

Hello everyone,
                I will be hosting a beginners parkour workshop tomorrow (Wednesday October 9th) from 5-6pm in the Quad. During this workshop we will teach a few of the basic techniques and attempt to answer any questions you
 have about parkour. 
 
A bit about parkour:
Parkour is a training discipline in which you develop strength, agility, balance, flexibility, and endurance by practicing fundamental movement techniques including running, jumping, vaulting, and climbing. It was
 developed originally by the French militia as a form of obstacle training for efficient movement but has evolved to accommodate a wider range of movements since then. We focus on safe progressions of developing your self-awareness and mobility. Unlike the
 common misconception parkour isn’t about jumping off buildings, flipping, and being dangerous. It is about safely developing your abilities and increasing your level of fitness through training safe movements.

 
A bit about me:
I have been training for nearly 3 years and been to several teaching workshops. I have been teaching informally for about 2 years. In this time I have learned many techniques of how to help practitioners of all
 ages, skill levels, and fitness levels. I have spoken with several leaders in the practice about how to teach and how they have trained so that we can further develop the practice. I have competed in several national contests and placed in one of them.

 
I train most days of the week so if you aren’t able to come tomorrow but are still interested please email me to arrange a time to join or talk about the sport with me.

 
Thanks,
                Seth Rujiraviriyapinyo"

“Microwave synthesis, a New Method or Just a Lot of Heat?”
 
Microwave synthesis has become much more popular in the synthetic literature, especially for organometallic catalysis in organic synthesis. Often, these synthetic pathways are higher yielding and give fewer side products. Several research projects will be presented that utilize microwave energy to provide the heating. We will then examine these different synthetic pathways and determine if microwave synthesis is a distinct method or simply another way to add heat to a reaction mixture."

"CURRICULUM DESIGN presented by Jeffrey Froyd, 10th period, 10/29","Curriculum DesignPresented by:Jeffrey E. FroydTEES Research Professor
Engineering Student Services and Academic Programs Dwight Look College of Engineering | Texas A&M University
Tuesday, October 29, 20134:20 p.m. in the GM Room
Abstract:  Curriculum design juxtaposes two ideas on which considerable work has been done separately: curriculum and design. However, it appears to be comparatively rare that scholarship on the two areas is merged. The seminar is intended to explore implications if a merger was attempted. For design methodology, the seminar will briefly consider the function-behavior-structure (FBS) framework. For curriculum, the seminar will briefly consider four lenses: content delivery, student development, certification/evaluation/accreditation, and instructor. These broad perspectives may help faculty members consider innovative alternative curriculum designs.
 
Bio:  Jeffrey E. Froyd served as Project Director for the Foundation Coalition, one of six NSF Engineering Education Coalitions. He co-created the Integrated, First-Year Curriculum in Science, Engineering and Mathematics at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, which TIAA-CREF recognized in 1997 with a Hesburgh Award Certificate of Excellence. He authored over 70 papers on engineering education, including many ASEE conference publications.  He has been the PI or co-PI on grants totaling over $35 million.  He is an ABET Program Evaluator, Editor-in-Chief for the IEEE Transactions, a Senior Associate Editor for the Journal on Engineering Education, an ASEE Fellow, and an IEEE Fellow."

Abstract:
Ultrasonic welding is a relatively new technique for joining plastic parts. It provides a rapid and economical way for assembly of mass produced, high quality products in plastic materials. The design of an ultrasonic welding process poses a number of challenges to the process developers. This presentation will provide an overview of the factors that have to be taken into account and the decisions that have to be made when a new ultrasonic welding process is put in place. The presentation is based on first-hand experience gained during a sabbatical leave.

Willing to pay, prices negotiable. Possible $20?

Difficult Conversations:  Practical Strategies for Discussing What Matters Most,"Difficult Conversations: Practical Strategies for Discussing What Matters Most
 
Thursday, December 12, 2013
1:35 – 2:25 p.m.
HMU – Heritage Room
 
Presenter: Julia Williams, Executive Director of Institutional Research, Planning and Assessment and Professor of English with tenure
 
Summary:
All of us have had to engage in a difficult conversation:  with a manager about a failed project, with a teenager about a missed curfew, with a spouse about whose turn it is to clean the kitchen.  In every case, we may wish to avoid the conversation, thinking that not talking about difficult topics will be better than confronting the issue.  Unfortunately not talking can damage feelings and jeopardize the relationship.  
 
In this session, we will learn practical strategies that can make having a difficult conversation much less threatening.  Using the book Difficult Conversations by Stone, Patton, and Heen, we will consider proven strategies that can empower you to work through a difficult conversation and emerge on the other side with productive results.  There will also be opportunities to put the strategies to the test in various scenarios.  I hope you can join us!

"CSSE Faculty Candidate Seminar - Wednesday, December 4, 10th hour","COMPUTER SCIENCE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING SEMINAR
DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS COMMUNICATION AND 
OVERCOMING THE
IMPOSSIBLE IN COMPLEX EVENT PROCESSING
Gregory
Wilkin
Purdue
University
 
Wednesday,
December 4, 4:20 PM, Olin 159
 
An incredibly vital aspect of any distributed system is the
communication of data, which can be one of the most challenging.  Recently,
event-based systems, distributed systems which communicate ""occurrences of
interest"" by means of a push-based protocol for data communication, are
becoming increasingly popular in spite of many inherent complexities.  The
propagation of single events efficiently and in a fault-tolerant manner is an
arduous task since many event-based systems observe a substantial number of
events (hundreds of thousands to millions per second).  Even when events
are received in a timely manner, making sense of their inherent meaning has
nearly become an insurmountable effort.  Complex event processing is the
process of correlating events together as a single entity (termed relations) to
convey some higher order meaning to better view the forest from the trees. 
Current applications that take advantage of such correlation include
algorithmic stock trading, weather observation/prediction, credit card fraud
detection, the Social Web and many others.  In spite of its popularity,
most systems provide only ""best-effort guarantees"" on the delivery of
relations due to a number of fundamental impossibilities intrinsic to
distributed systems.  Alarmingly, these systems fail frequently and with
catastrophic results.  Is there any way we can overcome these ""impossibilities""
and offer stronger guarantees on the delivery of relations?  If so, what sort of ""guarantees"" are even feasible?  This
presentation will address the answers to these questions, along with a general
overview of distributed system communication, event-based systems and complex
event processing.
Everyone is
welcome!"

We need about 10 small ensembles / solo acts to round out the show. If you are interested in auditioning, please fill out the attached form and return to me by Wednesday Jan. 15, 2014.

For background information about the show, please read on. 

Engineers in Concert was started in 1981 by Dr. Joan Singer Spicknall and then student David Dvorak as an evening highlighting the talents of Rose-Hulman students, faculty and staff. For many years, the show was produced and directed by Dr. Mallory North, Proefssor Emeritus of Mechanical Engineering. In 2003, the show culminated a week of performances celebrating the opening of Hatfield Hall and honoring the memory of Mr. Dvorak. The show features all genres of fine perfoming arts from classical, jazz, folk, and sacred music to juggling and dance. Dr. Brad Burchett has been directing the show since 2004.

Open Letter in Support of HJR-6,"Below is a copy of an email I have sent to Dr. Conwell, President of Rose-Hulman, in response to the campus wide email sent out by Dr. Tilstra. I am simply using my right to freedom of speech to express my viewpoint on the issue. I made this an open-letter because I believe there are other members of the Rose-Hulman Community whose opinions on this issue align with mine. Regardless of your stance on the topic, you should let your voice be heard and express it to the institution's leadership before they make a decision on a public statement regarding HJR-6.

Dr. Conwell,

Earlier today, Dr. Tilstra sent an email to the entire campus regarding the Indiana legislature’s vote on House Joint Resolution-6 (HJR-6). She was requesting student, faculty, and staff support to convince Institute leadership to issue a strong statement in opposition of HJR-6. I wanted to share my viewpoint on what is being proposed so that both sides can be considered.

I want to begin by proudly stating that I am a follower of Jesus Christ. Being such, I have nothing but love and respect for all humanity, including those who engage in homosexual acts. Being a Christian, my moral values are firmly rooted in the Bible, and I would like to share a few verses that are related to the topic at hand:

“Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.” -1 Corinthians 6:9-10 ESV

“You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.” –Leviticus 18:22 ESV

“But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.” -1 Corinthians 7:2 ESV

The unrighteous acts described in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 show that sin is sin. A drunkard is just as guilty as a thief, adulterer, or person who practices homosexuality. The state of Indiana currently has laws in place aimed at preventing theft, adultery and drunkenness; and in doing so prevents citizens from engaging in sin. In HJR-6, the legislature is attempting to pass another law to help the people avoid committing such an abomination. The last verse, 1 Corinthians 7:2, is in strong support of HJR-6 and preserving the sanctity of marriage. All of these verses come from the very same book Presidents of the United States have placed their hand on when they were sworn into office.

If Rose-Hulman were to issue a statement in opposition of a HJR-6 as suggested, it would be nothing less than saying Rose-Hulman is in support of unrighteousness or sin. Knowingly promoting of a sin that God has deemed an abomination would be a terrible mistake for the university.

I am also disappointed that the institution is only seeking the opinions of community members who oppose HJR-6 without even considering the students, faculty, and staff who are in support of the proposed law. Even if the institution members responsible for issuing a public statement choose to deny the existence of God Almighty and defy his Word, they cannot ignore the community members in support of HJR-6. Any such statement would not be an accurate reflection of all the individuals who make up Rose-Hulman. 

Again, I would like to state that I have nothing but love and respect for all humanity, including those who engage in any of the unrighteous acts mentioned in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10. I completely respect Dr. Tilstra’s position on the issue, and the positions of other members of the Rose-Hulman Community. I simply request the same respect for my viewpoint.

Though I am very proud to be a member of the #1 Engineering School in the nation, I would be even more disappointed to be a part of an institution that is against the Lord.

Sincerely,

Gordon M. Hazzard
Concerned Student"
Open Letter to All Bible Thumpers,"Dear Bible Thumpers, your religion has no place in our government's legislation. Warmest regards, Matthew Hayes"
Tolerance at Rose-Hulman,"The Rose-Hulman community is home to individuals of a wide variety of religious and political beliefs. Although we disagree on many issues, it is important that we still respect each other as adults, even when we disagree. This is, in fact, an informal definition of tolerance. A counterexample to this would be to using a religious slur against a Christian who does not support HJR-6.

The definition of marriage is a hot button issue in the United States, which is what HJR-6 is concerned with. Earlier today, Dr. Tilstra sent out a campus-wide email seeking signatures for a letter that reads as follows:

“It is the opinion of the undersigned members of Rose-Hulman’s faculty, staff, and student body that Institute leadership should issue a strong statement in opposition to HJR-6.”

Regardless of where you stand on this issue, ask yourself: Is it right for institute leadership to make a statement opposing HJR-6 on behalf of the entire Rose-Hulman community, even on behalf of those who disagree? To those who oppose the bill, ask yourself: how would you feel if Rose were to issue a statement on your behalf, endorsing something that you did not believe in?

Communities are nothing more than the individuals that they are composed of. This is not about the definition of marriage, this is about recognizing the individuality and diversity that make Rose, Rose.

Thank you for your time."
RE: Open Letter to All Bible Thumpers,"While I do realize that Sharepoint is not the place to be discussing/arguing this, I must point out an issue with this post.

The United States of America was founded on religion. It is part of the defining characteristics of our founding fathers, and even in the Declaration of Independence, it states ""that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.""

The Creator is also referred to prior in the Declaration as Nature's God. In no unclear terms, religion has been part of this country's government since the beginning.

Yes, homosexuals are equal people, but the country WAS founded on religion. To declare otherwise is to ignore the very founding of our country."

That is all."
note on contacting Indiana Legislators,"I know that for most people this is a given, but please if you are NOT a resident of Indiana (i.e. your permanent address is in Indiana) that you don't ask Indiana legislators to vote a specific way. 

Whatever the Indiana government decides on this matter, it should be based on its actual residents views and not be skewed by the views of people who go to college in Indiana but are from another state. 

If you are not from Indiana, but feel strongly on this situation make sure that you contact your legislator in your respective state."

Here's a jolly good idea.,Stop using SharePoint as a platform to argue socio-political issues.
An open letter on how to use Sharepoint,"Hi everyone. I just wanted to take a moment to remind you all how Sharepoint operates. When you create a message on here, it sends it out to the entire Rose community. This service is intended to allow you to post advertisements and contact everyone who might be interested, like a bulletin board. Please do not use this service to debate issues. If you feel so inclined, each Sharepoint includes a name at the bottom. Contact the poster directly. Do not spam the entire community with something they likely don't care about. When you abuse this ability, it devalues what would otherwise be a useful service. Please don't ruin it for everyone else. Thank you."

ANONYMIZATION, DE-IDENTIFICATION, AND ENCRYPTION:
DATA PRIVACY IN THREE ACTS
Raymond Heatherly

Wednesday, January 15, 4:20 PM, Olin 169
 
 
Frequently, the concept of privacy in data is
reduced to a binary ""is it safe"" or ""is it not""
measure.  However, the reality of data is
that no single solution fits all circumstances. 
Here, we will examine some of the most common methods used in practice
for protecting a variety of personally-identifiable data.  Through this, attendees will begin to see
some of the complexities involved in data protection and understand the choices
that data holders face when storing and using this data.

 “Antimicrobial Polymers: A Quest for New Antimicrobials”
 
Antimicrobials play an important role in consumer and personal care products, as well as in healthcare. More specifically, antibiotics have been critical in the fight against infectious diseases caused by bacteria. Unfortunately, these microbes are able to mutate and become resistant to antibiotic therapies.  For example, the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus has evolved from penicillin-resistant phenotypes into a methicillin-resistant strain (MRSA), which has become a global epidemic. It is apparent that there is an urgent need for new antimicrobial agents that are not easily susceptible to resistance. 
 
Traditional antimicrobials, such as penicillin and methicillin are small molecules that kill microbes by attacking different inhibitory-targets within various microbial biosynthetic pathways, i.e. they attack targets within the microbe. Although these mechanisms yield therapeutic specificity, pathogens are able to develop drug resistance through mutation. As an alternative to small molecule antimicrobials, significant effort has been put forth to develop macromolecular antimicrobials that kill bacteria via a membrane disruption, thus reducing the possibility of microbes developing resistance due to the physical nature of membrane disruption. This talk will focus on our recent advances in the design of new macromolecular antimicrobials."

MODELS AND ALGORITHMS FOR PHYLOGENETIC RECONSTRUCTION
Yi-Chieh (Jessica) Wu
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
 
Tuesday, January 21, 4:20 PM, Olin 169
 
Computational
techniques have long been applied to biological data to address a wide range of
evolutionary questions.  In phylogenetics, methods for reconstructing gene histories
from sequence data have enabled researchers to better understand how evolution
shapes gene content; for example, the identification of evolutionarily-related
genes has allowed for the mapping of functions across species and the discovery
of novel functions.  Such predictions
have become increasingly important over the last ten to fifteen years, as
technology has reduced the cost of sequencing and increased processing power,
leading to vast genomic datasets with little, if any, functional
information.  In turn, the growing
availability of genomes has enabled comparative genomics, leading to increased
power for biological signal discovery and revealing insight into the core
evolutionary forces that govern our existence.
However,
to realize the full potential in genomic and evolutionary studies, we require
accurate, efficient, and scalable methods that are widely applicable.  In this talk, I address this need by
developing novel computational approaches for reconstructing gene evolutionary
histories.  In particular, I consider
models for gene family evolution that take into account duplication, loss,
horizontal gene transfer, and nucleotide or amino acid substitution, and I
present new phylogenetic algorithms for eukaryotic and prokaryotic gene tree
reconstruction.  Through extensive
benchmarking, I show that these methods dramatically improve reconstructions
compared to state-of-the-art programs; in addition, they are efficient and
require few modeling assumptions or parameters, making them applicable to a
broad range of species and large datasets.
These
results demonstrate the power of computational phylogenetics,
and I believe that with the continued development and adoption of such methods,
we can address fundamental biological questions with many important
implications for future investigations of gene and genome evolution.
Everyone is
welcome!"

GUI TESTING AT IBM: CHALLENGES AND DIRECTION

Thursday, January 23, 4:20 PM, Olin 167
 
 
Application developers use a
variety of graphical user interface components, or ""widgets"" (such as
buttons, sliders, and rich-text editors) to create appealing user interfaces.
To save time, developers reuse widgets from third-party widget libraries, such
as Swing for Java development and the IBM Dojo Toolkit for Web development.
Developers trust that the implementations of widget libraries are correct and
have been tested. But who establishes this trust? If you were to write your own
widget, how would you ensure it works in all applications and on all platforms?
Gain an inside perspective from IBM on the state of the art in widget
development and testing, including a glimpse at open-source automated testing
tools in development, as well as a discussion of remaining research challenges
in testing.

NATURE-INSPIRED DEFENSE PLATFORM FOR CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
Mohamed Eltoweissy
Video Semantics, LLC
 
Friday, January 31, 4:20 PM, Olin 167
 
 
 
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) entail tight coupling and
coordination of cyber and physical resources. Emerging CPS promise significant enhancements
in the safety, efficiency and reliability of numerous systems ranging from national
security and defense, to smart infrastructure systems in energy, healthcare and
transportation, to worldwide social interactions and gaming. Enhanced CPS resilience
and defense intelligence are precursors to fulfilling the CPS promise. To this
end, our work aims to: 
1.     
Achieve asymmetric advantage
to CPS defenders, prohibitively increasing the cost for attackers; 
2.     
Ensure resilient operations
in presence of persistent and evolving attacks and failures; and  
3.     
Facilitate defense alliances,
effectively and efficiently diffusing defense intelligence and operations
transcending organizational boundaries. 
In
this talk, I will present CyPhyCARD (Cooperative
Autonomous Resilient Defense platform for Cyber-Physical Systems) - a
distributed, dynamically configurable and programmable platform that manages a
large number of cyber and physical resources and service upon which
evolutionary defenses can be built to achieve the aforementioned goals. Following
an overview of CyPhyCARD, I will discuss in more
detail how CyPhyCARD mitigates the threat inherent in
monolithic software. CyPhyCARD possesses a set of platform-managed capabilities that
employ multidimensional software diversity to, in effect; induce spatiotemporal
“Software Behavior Encryption (SBE)” for trace resistance and moving target
defense. The key principles are: (1) decoupling functional roles from runtime
role players; (2) devising intrinsically-resilient composable
online-programmable building blocks; (3) separating logic, state and physical
resources; and (4) employing functionally-equivalent, behaviorally-different
code variants. Nodes autonomously and cooperatively change their SBE policies
both proactively and reactively according to the continual changes in context
and environment. Using analysis and simulation, results show that we can
encrypt the execution behavior by inducing confusion and diffusion at a
reasonable overhead.

INFORMATION FLOW PROPERTIES FOR SECURITY IN
CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
AND GRADUATE SCHOOL OPPORTUNITIES
Bruce McMillan
Missouri University of Science and Technology
 
Monday, February 3, 4:20 PM, Olin 259
 
 
 
A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is an engineered
physical system with a significant cyber component and consists of many
interacting distributed cyber and physical components. CPSs are deployed in
critical applications such as such as advanced power electronics in a green electric
power system, vehicles in an automated highway system, and consumer components of
a smart house in which correct operation is paramount. Unintended or
misunderstood interactions among the components of a CPS cause unpredictable behavior
leading to serious errors. While each component may independently function correctly,
their composition may yield incorrectness due to Interference. Interference that
violates correctness or security is well-understood in the purely software (cyber)
domain. In the CPS domain, interference is much less understood. Security and
confidentiality problems are particularly vexing. Recent attacks, such as Stuxnet show how Formal security properties can be violated
through physical interference with the cyber components. 
 
This talk presents an interpretation of formal
information flow properties and interference within the context of a
cyber-physical system using examples from the electric smart grid and poses the
deep scientific question: how to make such systems secure and correct? The
second part of the talk shows how you can help answer such deep scientific
questions through graduate study.

Hi,
 
I have a Yamaha Portable Grand that you could find on the internet in this condition for about 500 – 600 but would be willing to sell it for 400. It’s literally only about 3-4 months owned and straight out of the packaging. It comes with
 a stand, a pedal and has an integrated music stand.
 
I would really appreciate someone buying this. You’d be getting a great deal and I would be getting some much needed money back.
 
Please consider buying if you’re looking for one – I don’t have time to play anymore and need to sell this.
 
Thanks for your time,

Chemistry and Biochemistry Seminar,"Assays for Characterizing the Effect of Alcohols on the Estrogen Receptor
Katherine C. Dial
Wednesday, Feb. 5, 2014
5th Hour, G 317
Advisor Mark E. Brandt
Abstract:  Most types of breast cancer are induced by estrogen, acting via the estrogen receptor (ER).  The ligand binding domain (LBD) of the ER exists almost exclusively as a dimer, and the dimerization process is thought to be functionally important to ligand binding. We observe that small alcohols perturb functional properties of the protein, and a hypothesis to explain this is that alcohol loosens the 3D conformation of the protein. Several assays were evaluated, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) seems to be the most promising of these methods, and thus is being pursued. We seek to use this method to explain the effects of alcohol interactions with the ER-LBD."

“ Coding techniques for modern storage ”
 
Abstract:   Coding theory is the study of reliable communication over unreliable channels, including storage channels. This talk will focus on coding problems inspired by the structure of flash memory storage devices. After a brief introduction to classical coding theory and the flash memory problem, I will discuss two research directions related to this application. 
The first is the topic of rewriting codes, which originated in the study of write-once memories.  I will introduce a WOM code construction from a family of finite geometries and discuss generalizations. 
The second topic is the implementation of error-correcting codes in storage media. In particular, I will discuss low density parity check codes, graph representations, and iterative decoding.

IMAGE FORENSICS USING REFLECTIONS ON CURVED SURFACES

WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 26, 2014

1:00 P.M.

F225


Image forensics is the study of finding hidden information in photographs. This emerging field encompasses techniques for determining the source of an image, detecting forgery, and detecting steganography. Because pictures are used as hard evidence in journalism, scientific research, and criminal cases, having a strong arsenal of methods for detecting forgery is crucial. Many such methods rely on geometric properties of the image's content, such as mirrors. This research builds on existing methods for finding inconsistencies in reflections on planar mirrors by exploring techniques that would work for spherical mirrors."

Solid Phase Extraction Using Carbon Cryogels as an Alternative Media
Gregory Horne
Advisor:  Dr. Daniel Morris
 
Waste of exotic organic materials used in medicine, pest or weed removal pollutes water supplies. EPA method 525.1 describes a solid-phase extraction (SPE) preconcentration of pollutants in water followed by analysis using gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection.  SPE is an excellent candidate for removing these pollutants as it does not expose the water to organic solvents and works at trace concentrations. Carbon cryogels exhibit similar recoveries of trace amounts of 12 pollutants described in EPA method 525.1 when compared to the recoveries of commercially available octadecylsilane (ODS or C18) cartridges. The extractions can also be accomplished using less mass per extraction with carbon versus standard columns."

Rose Summer Undergraduate Research Program and Weaver Grants,"Rose Summer Undergraduate Research Program 
and 
Joseph B. and Reba A. Weaver Undergraduate Research Awards
 
Request for Proposals - Summer 2014 
 
Through the generosity of Joseph and Reba Weaver, Rose Hulman has been able to support summer undergraduate research for a few students each summer. This year we will be able to support more students though the RHIT Innovation Fund. The combined programs are called the Rose Summer Undergraduate Research Program (RSURP).  Proposals are invited from individual students in collaboration with a faculty mentor.
 
Awards will be made to individual students for up to a total of ten weeks during the summer of 2014 as follows: $3750 stipend and on-campus housing.  Students who decline RHIT housing shall not receive other housing support.  Equipment and supply costs for the research must be provided by the department(s) hosting the research.  
 
Currently enrolled freshmen, sophomore, and junior students in good standing (not on any kind of probation) are eligible.
 
Application deadline is Monday March 31, 2014.  Proposals must be submitted electronically via the Moodle group Rose Summer Undergraduate Research Program.  Award notification will be made by April 7, 2014.  Funds must be expended by August 31, 2014. 
 
Awardees will be required to submit a written report of the research to the Rose Scholar Digital Archives (or other public publication) and give a presentation to members of the Rose-Hulman community. The report and presentation must completed by May 31, 2015.  Awardees will not be permitted to engage in any other paid work at Rose-Hulman or Rose-Hulman Ventures during the period of the award.
 
Proposal Format
Cover page indicating title of research, one paragraph summary description suitable for the general public, and names of the student investigator and faculty mentor.
 
Two pages (maximum) of narrative description using single spaced, 12-pt font text.  The narrative must include the goals of the research, a project time line (including anticipated submission dates of report and presentation), and enough background information and discussion for the reviewers – Rose faculty – to decide on the scientific merit of the proposal.
 
Two additional pages (maximum) of references, figures, and tables.
 
One page containing a detailed budget indicating period of employment, stipend, RHIT housing costs if requested,  and indicating equipment/supplies to be purchased (from host department funds). A time period of fewer than 10 weeks will be considered but the stipend will be prorated. A time less than eight weeks is unlikely to be funded.   
 
A letter of support from the faculty mentor, committing to mentoring the student, committing to any departmental support for needed equipment/supplies (check with department head), and commenting on the student’s eligibility and ability to perform the research.  The letter of support should be submitted separately. The faculty mentor should guide the student in the writing of the proposal. 
 
Selection criteria
Proposals will be evaluated based on scientific merit and clarity of the proposal, specifically focusing on the goals of the research and the ability of the student to perform the research in the time given.  Specific comments on the potential impact to the Rose-Hulman and scientific communities are welcome.  Prior work by the student on related research may be taken into consideration but is not required.  The proposals are reviewed by a panel selected from the advisory board and other faculty volunteers. 
Questions related to the proposal should be addressed to Dr. Allen Broughton, Head of Mathematics. 
 
Advisory Board and Coordination
The RSURP program is governed by an advisory board. In addition to determining the program’s policies, they assist proposal review and serve as advocates for undergraduate research in their home departments. The RSURP program is coordinated with the academic year IP/ROP program, the IRC program (Interdisciplinary Research Collaborative), and RTI (Research Training Institute) a program to be to be rolled out next year.  So, for instance student may make coordinated proposals to the RSURP, the IRC and IP/ROP.

Bike lights for sale,"I have a set of bike lights for sale: headlight and taillight. Price $5 each. Both are Cateye brand. Both come with fully functional batteries; the batteries in the taillight are new.

The headlight takes one AA battery and is about 3.5 inches long and an inch in diameter. It has a single white LED with two modes, solid and flashing. You turn it on or off by pressing and holding the button for approx. one second. To change mode, press and release the button while the light is on.

The taillight takes 2 AAA batteries and has 5 red LEDs in a vertical arrangement and is about 4 inches long, 3/4 inch wide and 1-1/4 inches thick. It has several blinking modes as well as full-on mode. To turn on, press and release the button. To change mode, press and release the button while the light is in operation. To turn off, press and hold the button for approx. one second. 

Both lights attach to the bike with quick release brackets. The brackets themselves attach with a hand-tightened wheel and strap, sort of like a plastic hose clamp. The tails of the straps have been trimmed but there should still be enough length to fit around most handlebars and seatposts... if it cannot fit your bike you can return it for a refund. 

Both lights function properly; I'm selling since I have other lights I prefer and so do not use these any more. 

To buy, contact me at john.m.gardner@rose-hulman.edu"

Asking around if anyone has seen a backpack lying around, it is the school given black one and has a rose hulman tag on one of the bottom straps. It will not have any name it though as I lost the original tag so it will be blank. There
 will be two binders in it a black one and a blue/white striped rose hulman on. Please email me if you have seen it or seen a backpack lying around. It would mostly likely be in Percopo/moench/olin.

A WELL-BALANCED DIET: SHAKING UP THE WEB WITH MORE THAN JUST CODE
Sid Stamm
Senior Manager, Security and Privacy Engineering, Mozilla
Monday, May 5, 2014, 4:20 PM, F225 CSSE Lab
Sometimes writing code isn't quite enough for security and privacy. From phishing and hacking to eavesdropping and social engineering, there are many advantages and pitfalls within the socio-technical web; so can a blend of sociology, technology and politics be more powerful than code alone?
Sid Stamm is Senior Manager of Security and Privacy Engineering at Mozilla and oversees a team of engineers focused on integrating transparency and privacy into the fabric of the Web by building tools to give users more choice and control over their personal data online.

Research Participant Opportunity,"Dear Rose-Hulman Students:

You are invited to participate in a research study about learning; specifically, this study is an investigation of the effects of body posture on learning. By participating in this study, you may discover body postures that increase your learning. We request the participation of students who are 18 or older. You may be required to hold poses such as crossed-arms and legs propped upon a table for ten minutes. This study is being conducted by Alayna B. McNamara and Ella Ingram, from the Department of Applied Biology and Biomedical Engineering at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology; therefore, if you are currently enrolled in any of Dr. Ingram’s or Ms. McNamara’s courses, you are unable to participate.

If you choose to participate, you will first complete a trial that measures your confidence. This trial may last up to 30 minutes, scheduled at your convenience. If you complete this trial, you will receive $5 in Declining Balance. Additionally, you may be asked to participate in several trials on learning. Each of these sessions should last approximately 60 minutes, scheduled at your convenience.

Abstract
Discovery of Delta-Scuti Stars of the F3V Spectral Type
 
            We can observe many stars in our sky which change in their brightness over time. Some Main-Sequence stars which intersect the instability strip vary over periods as small as a few hours. During the winter last year, I observed 43 stars of the F3V spectral type in order to determine how many would show Delta-Scuti variability. During this talk, I will discuss what we expect from Delta-Scuti stars as well as the various methods used to process these observations into usable images. I will then show how we can use these images to create light curves, giving us an indication of the variability of the stars observed.

During the winter last year, I observed 43 stars of the F3V spectral type in order to determine how many would show Delta-Scuti variability. During this talk, I will discuss what we expect from Delta-Scuti stars as well as the various methods used to process these observations into usable images. I will then show how we can use these images to create light curves, giving us an indication of the variability of the stars observed.

I will ensure the sale complies with all state and federal laws. I reserve the right to refuse the sale to any person for any reason. 

If the gun sells, I will also have  extended magazines and several hundred rounds of .40 S&W ammunition for sale as well. 



You know that signing bonus is burning a hole in your pocket...

Looking For ECE for assistance designing PCB and using Eagle,"We are in need of having a few pcbs designed and made. Being ME's we are looking to find someone who has experience prototyping pcbs and circuit design. If you would like to make some extra cash and have relevant experience let us know. Being proficient with Eagle is a must.

Our first job is very simple, you will need to take mechanical data (dxf output) and lay it out in eagle format so that we can send it to the fab shop. If this is done well and after some development there will be some more substantial jobs for you.

If interested, send me an email at kenneybc@rose-hulman.edu and give us a good reason to give you the job."

whole turkeys for sale,"Whole turkeys available starting July 10; delivery to your home/office included, date/time arranged at your convenience. Ethically raised on fresh grass and plenty of sunshine. $3 per pound, average size 16-20 pounds. Pay on delivery. Email ingram@rose-hulman.edu to reserve yours now.

Why buy a turkey in July? 
Cooking a whole turkey heats the kitchen once but yields multiple meals (enchiladas, turkey noodle casserole, etc.). Having a turkey in the freezer is advanced preparation on holiday meals. Turkey meat can be ground or diced and used as a lean replacement for beef. Turkey is delicious!

Why buy these turkeys? 
These turkeys get fresh grass twice daily, live in a natural setting, yet are protected from predators. They exhibit all their expected turkey behaviors. They have a constant supply of fresh water, and are clean and happy. They eat good food without any growth promoters. The processing is done without additives (no salt or MSG), and they are flash frozen to lock in juiciness."
Pasture-raised pork for sale,"Maple Valley Farm in Bloomington is taking orders for pork. Their heritage and mixed-breed pigs are raised on pasture and are free to eat grass, nuts, acorns and other food available in the pasture and woods. They are supplemented with a mixture of non-GMO corn, roasted soybeans, oats and minerals to be sure they get enough protein to grow. They are moved to fresh pastures and wooded areas regularly. The pigs are never fed medicated food, antibiotics, or steroids and nothing is added during processing. The pork will be ready in the next couple of weeks, so place your order now. For more information, see http://store.howardfamilyweb.com/10-grass-fed-pork

King's Island Trip This Weekend!,"Hello my fellow Rosebuds. A few friends and myself are going to King's Island this Saturday, and thought it'd be pretty neat if we invited the rest of the Rose stragglers that are ever-so-joyfully stuck in Terre Haute this summer. I think we could all use some action, rollercoaster action that is. So here are the deets: 

King's Island opens at 1000 and it’s a 3-hour drive, so we're thinking of leaving Terredise at 0630. That gives a wee bit of a cushion for, well, weeing. Tickets are $31 per person for a group of 15 or more, $44 online for individual tickets, and $60 at the gate. Depending on who and how many, car-pooling is definitely going to be the tactic in the transportation arena, unless someone owns some pretty fast camels that we could borrow, that’d be chill too. I’m down with camels. 

Just send me an email at costonbj@rose-hulman.edu if you're interested in going so I can start to get some idea of the car-pooling situation. Toodles"

"I HAVE A LAKESIDE 1 LOFT TO SELL TO YOU, MY FRIEND!","Hello, 

I have a seven-foot tall loft that I am looking to sell.  It is meant to cover the back part of a lakeside 1 room.  

365 days ago, I hand-crafted this loft in my humble, tall, empty lakeside 1 living space.  A lot of money was put into purchasing only the high quality pieces of wood and screws from Menard's; each piece of wood was inspected carefully to ensure the longevity and stability of the loft. The upper level is supported by eight pillars of wood, and there are also some extra pieces of wood, if they buyer wants to make the structure even more stable than it already is.

The price that I am asking for this one-of-a-kind, customizable, never-before-seen, #ThisLoftIsSuperAwesome loft is $200, but am willing to negotiate.  Please email me at chonge@rose-hulman.edu if interested, and I can send you some pictures of what the loft looks like.

Research Participation Opportunity,"Dear Rose-Hulman Students: 
 
You are invited to participate in a research study about learning; specifically, this study is an investigation of the effects of body posture on learning. By participating in this study, you may discover body postures that increase your learning. 
 
We request the participation of students who are 18 or older. You may be required to hold poses such as crossed-arms and legs propped upon a table for ten minutes. This study is being conducted by Alayna B. McNamara and Ella Ingram, from the Department of Biology and Biomedical Engineering at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology; therefore, if you are currently enrolled in any of Dr. Ingram’s or Ms. McNamara’s courses, you are unable to participate. 
 
If you choose to participate, you may first complete a trial that measures your confidence. This trial may last up to 30 minutes, scheduled at your convenience. If you complete this trial, you will receive $5 in Declining Balance. Additionally, you may be asked to participate in several trials on learning. Each of these sessions should last approximately 60 minutes, scheduled at your convenience. Participation in this study may involve up to five different trials; after the completion of each trial, you will receive $10 in cash; if you complete the entirety of the trials, you will receive a $20 completion bonus in cash. 
 
You may withdraw from the study at any time, and if you choose to do so, you will be compensated for your time and any data collected from you will be destroyed and not utilized in any subsequent analysis. 
 
Thank you for your consideration to participate in this research study. Please contact either of us if you would like to enroll or have other questions.

AbstractSabbatical Leave: Why it’s good for you (and why it is not)!
 
I spent my sabbatical year working on a variety of projects. Some of these projects represented a continuation of work that I have been engaged in for the last few years. Others represented forays into new areas. Before the start of my sabbatical I had three students who were working on various aspects of this project. Two of the three were senior who were planning to do their undergraduate thesis on work in this area. Given the quality of their work and my commitment to them, I made myself available to them throughout this year. Evidence of this was the fact that I supervised eight research hours of coursework during my sabbatical year. This was also made possible by the fact that my other projects resulted in some travel but otherwise did not require me to move to a different university or research center.
In this presentation I would like to share with you what I have learned and how I see this valuable experience as providing me with opportunities and ideas for future research and professional growth.

Interest for cryptocurrency club?,"Hey, everyone. Given the quick and easy nature of club-founding at Rose-Hulman, I thought it may be worth it to see if I could get together a group of people interested in cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc.) and possibly create a club if there's enough interest. Potential activities include:

* Weekly meetings to discuss new happenings in the world of cryptocoins - For example, the release of GAW Miners' new ""Hashlet"" model of ASIC miners.

* Occasional seminars open to all students, giving information about cryptocurrencies and handing out free ""paper wallet"" gifts that contain a small amount of one cryptocurrency.

* Coordinating a ""group-buy"" for a Rose-Hulman ASIC unit.

* Discussing possible applications for the use of cryptocurrency on-campus - For example, enabling on-campus stores (such as the bookstore) to accept Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

If anyone is already involved in cryptocurrencies or would like to become involved, please email me at kuhnerdm@rose-hulman.edu. I will probably end up making a Skype/Lync group for us so that we can discuss getting the club started. Thanks!

"Free Money, Amazon Prime Signups, and the angry ramblings of a tired man...","So a few people have deemed it necessary to spam our already-cluttered Sharepoints with a free student Amazon prime signup link.

I'm already not a fan of how Sharepoint is used (for books, that whole HJR-6 debacle, etc.) but I'm not up on my soapbox to rant about that.

To the point - as of September 1st, Amazon released a new promotion, that allows people to earn $3 whenever somebody else signs up for a free prime account with their referral link.

Now, I think that promotion is a pretty cool idea - but Sharepoint is not the place for you to rake in cash.

EVEN SO, if you somehow deem it necessary to spam Sharepoint to make your money (as 4 people apparently already have), at least inform your audience about what you're doing.

More significantly, measurement techniques that are central to chemistry also offer significant potential insight into engineering systems.  For example, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Time-of Flight Mass Spectrometry (TOFMS) give insight into combustion initiation and propagation mechanisms.  Conveniently, some engineering systems offer potential new applications in analytical chemistry.  Dr. White spent the 2013-14 academic year in the Hieftje Laboratory for Spectrochemistry in the Department of Chemistry at Indiana University Bloomington and will discuss these connections, specifically chemical analysis of internal combustion engines, and the application of an automotive spark system as an ambient ionization source for mass spectrometry."

Hello gamers,
 
Looking to trade my PS4 for your Xbox One. My friends all have the One and I’m looking to find a good deal/trade since they’re even systems and simply a matter of preference
 now-a-days.
I have Last of Us, Destiny, and Watchdogs on-disc, one controller with a charger and the default headset.
 
I really hope there’s someone out there that is interested in this – the console is in mint condition and I’m willing to trade for JUST the console (you don’t have to feel
 like you need to throw in a ton of games or whatever, as long as everything is there hardware wise.
 
Thanks for any interest – my contact info is as seen below,

9th hour in GM Room
Reception will follow and refreshments will be served in CSSE Lab, F226
Rose-BUD
is sponsoring a technical talk from Raquel Hill, an Associate Professor of
Computer Science in the School of Informatics and Computing. Her primary
research interests are in the areas of trust and security of distributed
computing environments and data privacy with a specific interest in privacy
protection mechanisms for medical-related datasets. She holds B.S. and M.S.
degrees in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology and a
Ph.D. in Computer Science from Harvard University.
Dr.
Hill will be talking about her research involving data privacy related to the
work of behavioral scientists. In this work, Dr. Hill seeks to determine
whether attributes that make a participant unique within a high-dimensional
social science dataset can be used to identify that individual. She will also
present new results of a use-case analysis that evaluates Differential Privacy
as a technique to protect behavioral science datasets while preserving their
research utility. The essential goal is to prevent a possible adversary from
discovering whether or not some specific individual's data is present in a
differentially private dataset, given some risk threshold.​

Designing Effective Task Training Strategies for
Human-Robot Instruction


 


Allison Sauppe


 


University of Wisconsin-Madison


 


Tuesday, December 16, 2014, 4:20 PM, Olin 167


 


Robots are becoming increasingly visible members of society, from
working in factories to helping in the home. As robots move from working alone
to collaborating alongside humans, there are many technical and design
challenges that have yet to be overcome. This talk will focus on the potential
of robots to instruct human users in a task, investigating how a robot can
provide its students with instructions in a way that maximizes their task
performance. I will present the design process for creating an autonomous
instructional robot that instructs users in a pipe assembly task. Additionally,
I will discuss key instructional strategies human instructors use, their
implementation on a robot, and their evaluation in a human-robot task. The
results from the evaluation reveal tradeoffs between instructional strategies,
offering implications for the design of instructional robots and directions for
future work.

BOSS: An Optimization Framework for Causal Inference with
Observational Data


 


Jason J. Sauppe


 


University of Illinois


 


Monday, December 15, 2014, 4:20 PM, Olin 167


 


Causal inference is the process of identifying
relationships between events and outcomes, and it is used in a wide range of
scientific fields. A well-known example is the clinical trial, where treatment
and control groups are formed and studied to determine the efficacy of a new
drug or vaccine. In many situations the available data is observational, or
non-random, which presents particular challenges for causal inference. The
Balance Optimization Subset Selection (BOSS) model is designed to address these
difficulties by identifying an appropriate subset of data from which causal
estimates can be constructed. BOSS accomplishes this by formulating and solving
a discrete optimization problem. This talk will explore the computational
complexity of the optimization problem, both in general and for several special
cases. Approximation results will also be discussed.


 


Everyone is welcome to attend!"

CSSE Seminar - Regaining Control of Your Online Privacy,"​
Computer Science and Software Engineering Seminar Regaining Control of Your Online Privacy Sid StammPrincipal Engineer, Security and Privacy,
Mozilla Corporation, andVisiting Assistant Professor of CSSE, Rose-Hulman Wednesday, January 7, 2015, 4:20 PM, Olin 159 It seems like every day there’s a new story on the
news about how yet another company lost personal data of their employees or
customers to hackers.  But it’s not just hackers who want to trade
intricate details of your life.  On the Internet, your data is like gold
to criminals and companies alike.  To make it even more stressful, the
complexity of the online world requires someone to be a privacy expert to make
well-informed decisions about every Facebook or Snapchat sharing
decision.  So how can we make this better? This talk explores Mozilla’s
approach to helping people regain control over their online lives.  The
most effective online safety tools are not purely technological, and it is
becoming evident that we need holistic approaches that consider both the social
and technological implications of the vast Internet ecosystem."
